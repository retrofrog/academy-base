# Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

## Introduction to Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

### Active Directory Explained

`Active Directory` (`AD`) is a directory service for Windows enterprise environments that was officially implemented in 2000 with the release of Windows Server 2000 and has been incrementally improved upon with the release of each subsequent server OS since. AD is based on the protocols x.500 and LDAP that came before it and still utilizes these protocols in some form today. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organizationâ€™s resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides `authentication, accounting, and authorization` functions within a Windows enterprise environment. If this is your first time learning about Active Directory or hearing these terms, check out the [Intro To Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue) module for a more in-depth look at the structure and function of AD, AD objects, etc.

### Why Should We Care About AD?

At the time of writing this module, Microsoft Active Directory holds around `43%` of the [market share](https://www.slintel.com/tech/identity-and-access-management/microsoft-active-directory-market-share#faqs) for enterprise organizations utilizing `Identity and Access management` solutions. This is a huge portion of the market, and it isn't likely to go anywhere any time soon since Microsoft is improving and blending implementations with Azure AD. Another interesting stat to consider is that just in the last two years, Microsoft has had over `2000` reported vulnerabilities tied to a [CVE](https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html). AD's many services and main purpose of making information easy to find and access make it a bit of a behemoth to manage and correctly harden. This exposes enterprises to vulnerabilities and exploitation from simple misconfigurations of services and permissions. Tie these misconfigurations and ease of access with common user and OS vulnerabilities, and you have a perfect storm for an attacker to take advantage of. With all of this in mind, this module will explore some of these common issues and show us how to identify, enumerate, and take advantage of their existence. We will practice enumerating AD utilizing native tools and languages such as `Sysinternals`, `WMI`, `DNS`, and many others. Some attacks we will also practice include `Password spraying`, `Kerberoasting`, utilizing tools such as `Responder`, `Kerbrute`, `Bloodhound`, and much more.

We may often find ourselves in a network with no clear path to a foothold through a remote exploit such as a vulnerable application or service. Yet, we are within an Active Directory environment, which can lead to a foothold in many ways. The general goal of gaining a foothold in a client's AD environment is to `escalate privileges` by moving laterally or vertically throughout the network until we accomplish the intent of the assessment. The goal can vary from client to client. It may be accessing a specific host, user's email inbox, database, or just complete domain compromise and looking for every possible path to Domain Admin level access within the testing period. Many open-source tools are available to facilitate enumerating and attacking Active Directory. To be most effective, we must understand how to perform as much of this enumeration manually as possible. More importantly, we need to understand the "why" behind certain flaws and misconfigurations. This will make us more effective as attackers and equip us to give sound recommendations to our clients on the major issues within their environment, as well as clear and actionable remediation advice.

We need to be comfortable enumerating and attacking AD from both Windows and Linux, with a limited toolset or built-in Windows tools, also known as "`living off the land`." It is common to run into situations where our tools fail, are being blocked, or we are conducting an assessment where the client has us work from a `managed workstation` or `VDI instance` instead of the customized Linux or Windows attack host we may have grown accustomed to. To be effective in all situations, we must be able to adapt quickly on the fly, understand the many nuances of AD and know how to access them even when severely limited in our options.

### Real-World Examples

Let's look at a few scenarios to see just what is possible in a real-world AD-centric engagement:

**Scenario 1 - Waiting On An Admin**

During this engagement, I compromised a single host and gained `SYSTEM` level access. Because this was a domain-joined host, I was able to use this access to enumerate the domain. I went through all of the standard enumeration, but did not find much. There were `Service Principal Names` (SPNs) present within the environment, and I was able to perform a Kerberoasting attack and retrieve TGS tickets for a few accounts. I attempted to crack these with Hashcat and some of my standard wordlists and rules, but was unsuccessful at first. I ended up leaving a cracking job running overnight with a very large wordlist combined with the [d3ad0ne](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/rules/d3ad0ne.rule) rule that ships with Hashcat. The next morning I had a hit on one ticket and retrieved the cleartext password for a user account. This account did not give me significant access, but it did give me write access on certain file shares. I used this access to drop SCF files around the shares and left Responder going. After a while, I got a single hit, the `NetNTLMv2 hash` of a user. I checked through the BloodHound output and noticed that this user was actually a domain admin! Easy day from here.

***

**Scenario 2 - Spraying The Night Away**

Password spraying can be an extremely effective way to gain a foothold in a domain, but we must exercise great care not to lock out user accounts in the process. On one engagement, I found an SMB NULL session using the [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) tool and retrieved both a listing of `all` users from the domain, and the domain `password policy`. Knowing the password policy was crucial because I could ensure that I was staying within the parameters to not lock out any accounts and also knew that the policy was a minimum eight-character password and password complexity was enforced (meaning that a user's password required 3/4 of special character, number, uppercase, or lower case number, i.e., Welcome1). I tried several common weak passwords such as Welcome1, `Password1`, Password123, `Spring2018`, etc. but did not get any hits. Finally, I made an attempt with `Spring@18` and got a hit! Using this account, I ran BloodHound and found several hosts where this user had local admin access. I noticed that a domain admin account had an active session on one of these hosts. I was able to use the Rubeus tool and extract the Kerberos TGT ticket for this domain user. From there, I was able to perform a `pass-the-ticket` attack and authenticate as this domain admin user. As a bonus, I was able to take over the trusting domain as well because the Domain Administrators group for the domain that I took over was a part of the Administrators group in the trusting domain via nested group membership, meaning I could use the same set of credentials to authenticate to the other domain with full administrative level access.

***

**Scenario 3 - Fighting In The Dark**

I had tried all of my standard ways to obtain a foothold on this third engagement, and nothing had worked. I decided that I would use the [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) tool to attempt to enumerate valid usernames and then, if I found any, attempt a targeted password spraying attack since I did not know the password policy and didn't want to lock any accounts out. I used the [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) tool to first mashup potential usernames from the company's LinkedIn page. I combined this list with several username lists from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and, after using the `userenum` feature of Kerbrute, ended up with **516** valid users. I knew I had to tread carefully with password spraying, so I tried with the password `Welcome2021` and got a single hit! Using this account, I ran the Python version of BloodHound from my attack host and found that all domain users had RDP access to a single box. I logged into this host and used the PowerShell tool [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) to spray again. I was more confident this time around because I could a) view the password policy and b) the DomainPasswordSpray tool will remove accounts close to lockout from the target list. Being that I was authenticated within the domain, I could now spray with all domain users, which gave me significantly more targets. I tried again with the common password Fall2021 and got several hits, all for users not in my initial wordlist. I checked the rights for each of these accounts and found that one was in the Help Desk group, which had [GenericAll](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericall) rights over the [Enterprise Key Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#enterprise-key-admins) group. The Enterprise Key Admins group had GenericAll privileges over a domain controller, so I added the account I controlled to this group, authenticated again, and inherited these privileges. Using these rights, I performed the [Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) attack and retrieved the NT hash for the domain controller machine account. With this NT hash, I was then able to perform a DCSync attack and retrieve the NTLM password hashes for all users in the domain because a domain controller can perform replication, which is required for DCSync.

### This Is The Way

These scenarios may seem overwhelming with many foreign concepts right now, but after completing this module, you will be familiar with most of them (some concepts described in these scenarios are outside the scope of this module). These show the importance of iterative enumeration, understanding our target, and adapting and thinking outside the box as we work our way through an environment. We will perform many of the parts of the attack chains described above in these module sections, and then you'll get to put your skills to the test by attacking two different AD environments at the end of this module and discovering your own attack chains. Strap in because this will be a fun, but bumpy, ride through the wild world that is `enumerating` and `attacking` Active Directory.

***

### Practical Examples

Throughout the module, we will cover examples with accompanying command output. Most of which can be reproduced on the target VMs that can be spawned within the relevant sections. You will be provided RDP credentials to interact with some of the target VMs to learn how to enumerate and attack from a Windows host (`MS01`) and SSH access to a preconfigured Parrot Linux host (`ATTACK01`) to perform enumeration and attack examples from Linux. You can connect from the Pwnbox or your own VM (after downloading a VPN key once a machine spawns) via RDP using [FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/CommandLineInterface), [Remmina](https://remmina.org/), or the RDP client of your choice where applicable or the SSH client built into the Pwnbox or your own VM.

***

**Connecting via FreeRDP**

We can connect via command line using the command:

Introduction to Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:<MS01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:Academy_student_AD!
```

**Connecting via SSH**

We can connect to the provided Parrot Linux attack host using the command, then enter the provided password when prompted.

Introduction to Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ssh htb-student@<ATTACK01 target IP>
```

**Xfreerdp to the ATTACK01 Parrot Host**

We also installed an `XRDP` server on the `ATTACK01` host to provide GUI access to the Parrot attack host. This can be used to interact with the BloodHound GUI tool which we will cover later in this section. In sections where this host spawns (where you are given SSH access) you can also connect to it using `xfreerdp` using the same command as you would with the Windows attack host above:

Introduction to Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:<ATTACK01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
```

Most sections will provide credentials for the `htb-student` user on either `MS01` or `ATTACK01`. Depending on the material and challenges, some sections will have you authenticate to a target with a different user, and alternate credentials will be provided.

Throughout the course of this module you will be presented with multiple mini Active Directory labs. Some of these labs can take 3-5 minutes to fully spawn and be accessible via RDP. We recommend scrolling to the end of each section, clicking to spawn the lab, and then start reading through the material, so the environment is up by the time you reach the interactive portions of the section.

***

### Toolkit

We provide a Windows and Parrot Linux attack host in the accompanying lab for this module. All tools needed to perform all examples and solve all questions throughout the module sections are present on the hosts. The tools necessary for the Windows attack host, `MS01` are located in the `C:\Tools` directory. Others, such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, will load upon opening a PowerShell console window. Tools on the Linux attack host, `ATTACK01`, are either installed and added to the `htb-student` users' PATH or present in the `/opt` directory. You can, of course, (and it is encouraged) compile (where needed) and upload your own tools and scripts to the attack hosts to get in the habit of doing so or hosting them on an SMB share from the Pwnbox working with the tools that way. Keep in mind that when performing an actual penetration test in a client's network, it is always best to compile the tools yourself to examine the code beforehand and ensure there is nothing malicious hiding in the compiled executable. We don't want to bring infected tools into a client's network and expose them to an outside attack.

Have fun, and don't forget to think outside of the box! AD is immense. You will not master it overnight, but keep working at it, and soon the content in this module will be second nature.
