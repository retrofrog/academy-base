# Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

In the previous section, we explored some tools we can use from our Linux attack host for enumeration with valid domain credentials. In this section, we will experiment with a few tools for enumerating from a Windows attack host, such as SharpHound/BloodHound, PowerView/SharpView, Grouper2, Snaffler, and some built-in tools useful for AD enumeration. Some of the data we gather in this phase may provide more information for reporting, not just directly lead to attack paths. Depending on the assessment type, our client may be interested in all possible findings, so even issues like the ability to run BloodHound freely or certain user account attributes may be worth including in our report as either medium-risk findings or a separate appendix section. Not every issue we uncover has to be geared towards forwarding our attacks. Some of the results may be informational in nature but useful to the customer to help improve their security posture.

At this point, we are interested in other misconfigurations and permission issues that could lead to lateral and vertical movement. We are also interested in getting a bigger picture of how the domain is set up, i.e., do any trusts exist with other domains both inside and outside the current forest? We're also interested in pillaging file shares that our user has access to, as these often contain sensitive data such as credentials that can be used to further our access.

***

### TTPs

The first tool we will explore is the [ActiveDirectory PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps). When landing on a Windows host in the domain, especially one an admin uses, there is a chance you will find valuable tools and scripts on the host.

***

### ActiveDirectory PowerShell Module

The ActiveDirectory PowerShell module is a group of PowerShell cmdlets for administering an Active Directory environment from the command line. It consists of 147 different cmdlets at the time of writing. We can't cover them all here, but we will look at a few that are particularly useful for enumerating AD environments. Feel free to explore other cmdlets included in the module in the lab built for this section, and see what interesting combinations and output you can create.

Before we can utilize the module, we have to make sure it is imported first. The [Get-Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-module?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet, which is part of the [Microsoft.PowerShell.Core module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/?view=powershell-7.2), will list all available modules, their version, and potential commands for use. This is a great way to see if anything like Git or custom administrator scripts are installed. If the module is not loaded, run `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` to load it for use.

**Discover Modules**

We'll see that the ActiveDirectory module is not yet imported. Let's go ahead and import it.

**Load ActiveDirectory Module**

```

Now that our modules are loaded, let's begin. First up, we'll enumerate some basic information about the domain with the [Get-ADDomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-addomain?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.

#### Get Domain Info

```

This will print out helpful information like the domain SID, domain functional level, any child domains, and more. Next, we'll use the [Get-ADUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-aduser?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet. We will be filtering for accounts with the `ServicePrincipalName` property populated. This will get us a listing of accounts that may be susceptible to a Kerberoasting attack, which we will cover in-depth after the next section.

**Get-ADUser**

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName

Another interesting check we can run utilizing the ActiveDirectory module, would be to verify domain trust relationships using the [Get-ADTrust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adtrust?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet

**Checking For Trust Relationships**

```powershell-session

```

This cmdlet will print out any trust relationships the domain has. We can determine if they are trusts within our forest or with domains in other forests, the type of trust, the direction of the trust, and the name of the domain the relationship is with. This will be useful later on when looking to take advantage of child-to-parent trust relationships and attacking across forest trusts. Next, we can gather AD group information using the [Get-ADGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroup?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.

**Group Enumeration**

Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name

name
----
Administrators
Users
Guests
Print Operators
Backup Operators
Replicator

<SNIP>
```

We can take the results and feed interesting names back into the cmdlet to get more detailed information about a particular group like so:

**Detailed Group Info**

Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Backup Operators"

DistinguishedName : CN=Backup Operators,CN=Builtin,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : DomainLocal
Name              : Backup Operators
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : 6276d85d-9c39-4b7c-8449-cad37e8abc38
SamAccountName    : Backup Operators
SID               : S-1-5-32-551
```

Now that we know more about the group, let's get a member listing using the [Get-ADGroupMember](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroupmember?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.

#### Group Membership

Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators"

distinguishedName : CN=BACKUPAGENT,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
name              : BACKUPAGENT
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 2ec53e98-3a64-4706-be23-1d824ff61bed
SamAccountName    : backupagent
SID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5220
```

We can see that one account, `backupagent`, belongs to this group. It is worth noting this down because if we can take over this service account through some attack, we could use its membership in the Backup Operators group to take over the domain. We can perform this process for the other groups to fully understand the domain membership setup. Try repeating the process with a few different groups. You will see that this process can be tedious, and we will be left with an enormous amount of data to sift through. We must know how to do this with built-in tools such as the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module, but we will see later in this section just how much tools like BloodHound can speed up this process and make our results far more accurate and organized.

Utilizing the ActiveDirectory module on a host can be a stealthier way of performing actions than dropping a tool onto a host or loading it into memory and attempting to use it. This way, our actions could potentially blend in more. Next, we will walk through the PowerView tool, which has many features to simplify enumeration and dig deeper into the domain.

***

### PowerView

[PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon) is a tool written in PowerShell to help us gain situational awareness within an AD environment. Much like BloodHound, it provides a way to identify where users are logged in on a network, enumerate domain information such as users, computers, groups, ACLS, trusts, hunt for file shares and passwords, perform Kerberoasting, and more. It is a highly versatile tool that can provide us with great insight into the security posture of our client's domain. It requires more manual work to determine misconfigurations and relationships within the domain than BloodHound but, when used right, can help us to identify subtle misconfigurations.

Let's examine some of PowerView's capabilities and see what data it returns. The table below describes some of the most useful functions PowerView offers.

This table is not all-encompassing for what PowerView offers, but it includes many of the functions we will use repeatedly. For more on PowerView, check out the [Active Directory PowerView module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-powerview). Below we will experiment with a few of them.

First up is the [Get-DomainUser](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainUser/) function. This will provide us with information on all users or specific users we specify. Below we will use it to grab information about a specific user, `mmorgan`.

We saw some basic user information with PowerView. Now let's enumerate some domain group information. We can use the [Get-DomainGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGroupMember/) function to retrieve group-specific information. Adding the `-Recurse` switch tells PowerView that if it finds any groups that are part of the target group (nested group membership) to list out the members of those groups. For example, the output below shows that the `Secadmins` group is part of the `Domain Admins` group through nested group membership. In this case, we will be able to view all of the members of that group who inherit Domain Admin rights via their group membership.

**Recursive Group Membership**

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb>  Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse

```

Above we performed a recursive look at the `Domain Admins` group to list its members. Now we know who to target for potential elevation of privileges. Like with the AD PowerShell module, we can also enumerate domain trust mappings.

**Trust Enumeration**

We can use the [Test-AdminAccess](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Test-AdminAccess/) function to test for local admin access on either the current machine or a remote one.

**Testing for Local Admin Access**

Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01

ComputerName    IsAdmin
------------    -------
ACADEMY-EA-MS01    True 
```

Above, we determined that the user we are currently using is an administrator on the host ACADEMY-EA-MS01. We can perform the same function for each host to see where we have administrative access. We will see later how well BloodHound performs this type of check. Now we can check for users with the SPN attribute set, which indicates that the account may be subjected to a Kerberoasting attack.

**Finding Users With SPN Set**

```powershell-session

Test out some more of the tool's functions until you are comfortable using it. We will see PowerView quite a few more times as we progress through this module.

### SharpView

PowerView is part of the now deprecated PowerSploit offensive PowerShell toolkit. The tool has been receiving updates by BC-Security as part of their [Empire 4](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/data/module\_source/situational\_awareness/network/powerview.ps1) framework. Empire 4 is BC-Security's fork of the original Empire project and is actively maintained as of April 2022. We show examples throughout this module using the development version of PowerView because it is an excellent tool for recon in an Active Directory environment, and is still extremely powerful and helpful in modern AD networks even though the original version is not maintained. The BC-SECURITY version of [PowerView](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/data/module\_source/situational\_awareness/network/powerview.ps1) has some new functions such as `Get-NetGmsa`, used to hunt for [Group Managed Service Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview), which is out of scope for this module. It is worth playing around with both versions to see the subtle differences between the old and currently maintained versions.

Another tool worth experimenting with is SharpView, a .NET port of PowerView. Many of the same functions supported by PowerView can be used with SharpView. We can type a method name with `-Help` to get an argument list.

Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Help

Get_DomainUser -Identity <String[]> -DistinguishedName <String[]> -SamAccountName <String[]> -Name <String[]> -MemberDistinguishedName <String[]> -MemberName <String[]> -SPN <Boolean> -AdminCount <Boolean> -AllowDelegation <Boolean> -DisallowDelegation <Boolean> -TrustedToAuth <Boolean> -PreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -KerberosPreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -NoPreauth <Boolean> -Domain <String> -LDAPFilter <String> -Filter <String> -Properties <String[]> -SearchBase <String> -ADSPath <String> -Server <String> -DomainController <String> -SearchScope <SearchScope> -ResultPageSize <Int32> -ServerTimeLimit <Nullable`1> -SecurityMasks <Nullable`1> -Tombstone <Boolean> -FindOne <Boolean> -ReturnOne <Boolean> -Credential <NetworkCredential> -Raw <Boolean> -UACFilter <UACEnum> 
```

Here we can use SharpView to enumerate information about a specific user, such as the user `forend`, which we control.

```

Experiment with SharpView on the MS01 host and recreate as many PowerView examples as possible. Though evasion is not in scope for this module, SharpView can be useful when a client has hardened against PowerShell usage or we need to avoid using PowerShell.

### Shares

Shares allow users on a domain to quickly access information relevant to their daily roles and share content with their organization. When set up correctly, domain shares will require a user to be domain joined and required to authenticate when accessing the system. Permissions will also be in place to ensure users can only access and see what is necessary for their daily role. Overly permissive shares can potentially cause accidental disclosure of sensitive information, especially those containing medical, legal, personnel, HR, data, etc. In an attack, gaining control over a standard domain user who can access shares such as the IT/infrastructure shares could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data such as configuration files or authentication files like SSH keys or passwords stored insecurely. We want to identify any issues like these to ensure the customer is not exposing any data to users who do not need to access it for their daily jobs and that they are meeting any legal/regulatory requirements they are subject to (HIPAA, PCI, etc.). We can use PowerView to hunt for shares and then help us dig through them or use various manual commands to hunt for common strings such as files with `pass` in the name. This can be a tedious process, and we may miss things, especially in large environments. Now, let's take some time to explore the tool `Snaffler` and see how it can aid us in identifying these issues more accurately and efficiently.

***

### Snaffler

[Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) is a tool that can help us acquire credentials or other sensitive data in an Active Directory environment. Snaffler works by obtaining a list of hosts within the domain and then enumerating those hosts for shares and readable directories. Once that is done, it iterates through any directories readable by our user and hunts for files that could serve to better our position within the assessment. Snaffler requires that it be run from a domain-joined host or in a domain-user context.

To execute Snaffler, we can use the command below:

**Snaffler Execution**

Code: bash

```bash
Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data
```

The `-s` tells it to print results to the console for us, the `-d` specifies the domain to search within, and the `-o` tells Snaffler to write results to a logfile. The `-v` option is the verbosity level. Typically `data` is best as it only displays results to the screen, so it's easier to begin looking through the tool runs. Snaffler can produce a considerable amount of data, so we should typically output to file and let it run and then come back to it later. It can also be helpful to provide Snaffler raw output to clients as supplemental data during a penetration test as it can help them zero in on high-value shares that should be locked down first.

We may find passwords, SSH keys, configuration files, or other data that can be used to further our access. Snaffler color codes the output for us and provides us with a rundown of the file types found in the shares.

Now that we have a wealth of data about the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain (and hopefully clear notes and log file output!), we need a way to correlate it and visualize it. Let's dive deeper into `BloodHound` and see how powerful this tool can be during any AD-focused security assessment.

***

#### BloodHound

As discussed in the previous section, `Bloodhound` is an exceptional open-source tool that can identify attack paths within an AD environment by analyzing the relationships between objects. Both penetration testers and blue teamers can benefit from learning to use BloodHound to visualize relationships in the domain. When used correctly and coupled with custom Cipher queries, BloodHound may find high-impact, but difficult to discover, flaws that have been present in the domain for years.

First, we must authenticate as a domain user from a Windows attack host positioned within the network (but not joined to the domain) or transfer the tool to a domain-joined host. There are many ways to achieve this covered in the [File Transfer](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/file-transfers) module. For our purposes, we will work with SharpHound.exe already on the attack host, but it's worth experimenting with transferring the tool to the attack host from Pwnbox or our own VM using methods such as a Python HTTP server, smbserver.py from Impacket, etc.

If we run SharpHound with the `--help` option, we can see the options available to us.

Next, we can exfiltrate the dataset to our own VM or ingest it into the BloodHound GUI tool on MS01. We can do this on MS01 by typing `bloodhound` into a CMD or PowerShell console. The credentials should be saved, but enter `neo4j: HTB_@cademy_stdnt!` if a prompt appears. Next, click on the `Upload Data` button on the right-hand side, select the newly generated zip file, and click `Open`. An `Upload Progress` window will pop up. Once all .json files show 100% complete, click the X at the top of that window.

We can start by typing `domain:` in the search bar on the top left and choosing `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` from the results. Take a moment to browse the node info tab. As we can see, this would be a rather large company with over 550 hosts to target and trusts with two other domains.

Now, let's check out a few pre-built queries in the `Analysis` tab. The query `Find Computers with Unsupported Operating Systems` is great for finding outdated and unsupported operating systems running legacy software. These systems are relatively common to find within enterprise networks (especially older environments), as they often run some product that cannot be updated or replaced as of yet. Keeping these hosts around may save money, but they also can add unnecessary vulnerabilities to the network. Older hosts may be susceptible to older remote code execution vulnerabilities like [MS08-067](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms08-067-vulnerability-in-server-service-could-allow-remote-code-execution-ac7878fc-be69-7143-472d-2507a179cd15). If we come across these older hosts during an assessment, we should be careful before attacking them (or even check with our client) as they may be fragile and running a critical application or service. We can advise our client to segment these hosts off from the rest of the network as much as possible if they cannot remove them yet, but should also recommend that they start putting together a plan to decommission and replace them.

This query shows two hosts, one running Windows 7 and one running Windows Server 2008 (both of which are not "live" in our lab). Sometimes we will see hosts that are no longer powered on but still appear as records in AD. We should always validate whether they are "live" or not before making recommendations in our reports. We may write up a high-risk finding for Legacy Operating Systems or a best practice recommendation for cleaning up old records in AD.

**Unsupported Operating Systems**

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/unsupported.png)

We will often see users with local admin rights on their host (perhaps temporarily to install a piece of software, and the rights were never removed), or they occupy a high enough role in the organization to demand these rights (whether they require them or not). Other times we'll see excessive local admin rights handed out across the organization, such as multiple groups in the IT department with local admin over groups of servers or even the entire Domain Users group with local admin over one or more hosts. This can benefit us if we take over a user account with these rights over one or more machines. We can run the query `Find Computers where Domain Users are Local Admin` to quickly see if there are any hosts where all users have local admin rights. If this is the case, then any account we control can typically be used to access the host(s) in question, and we may be able to retrieve credentials from memory or find other sensitive data.

**Local Admins**

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/local-admin.png)

This is just a snapshot of the useful queries we can run. As we continue through this module, you will see several more that can be helpful in finding other weaknesses in the domain. For a more in-depth study on BloodHound, check out the module [Active Directory Bloodhound](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-bloodhound). Take some time and try out each of the queries in the `Analysis` tab to become more familiar with the tool. It's also worth experimenting with [custom Cypher queries](https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/) by pasting them into the `Raw Query` box at the bottom of the screen.

Keep in mind as we go through the engagement, we should be documenting every file that is transferred to and from hosts in the domain and where they were placed on disk. This is good practice if we have to deconflict our actions with the customer. Also, depending on the scope of the engagement, you want to ensure you cover your tracks and clean up anything you put in the environment at the conclusion of the engagement.

***

We have a great picture of the domain's layout, strengths, and weaknesses. We have credentials for several users and have enumerated a wealth of information such as users, groups, computers, GPOs, ACLs, local admin rights, access rights (RDP, WinRM, etc.), accounts configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs), and more. We have detailed notes and a wealth of output and experimented with many different tools to practice enumerating AD with and without credentials from Linux and Windows attack hosts. What happens if we are restricted with the shell we have or do not have the ability to import tools? Our client may ask us to perform all work from a managed host inside their network without internet access and no way to load our tools. We could land on a host as `SYSTEM` after a successful attack, but be in a position where it is very difficult or not possible to load tools. What do we do then? In the next section, we will look at how to perform actions while "Living Off The Land."

**Questions**

Using Bloodhound, determine how many Kerberoastable accounts exist within the INLANEFREIGHT domain. (Submit the number as the answer)

```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory.ps1
Get-Module
.\Snaffler.exe  -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -s -v data
#now open bloodhound gui -> upload data (the zip above)
#type domain: inlanefreight
#list all Kerberoastable 
13
```

What PowerView function allows us to test if a user has administrative access to a local or remote host?

```powershell
Import-Module PowerView.ps1
Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01
```

Run Snaffler and hunt for a readable web config file. What is the name of the user in the connection string within the file?

```powershell
.\Snaffler.exe  -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -s -v data
#<add name="myConnectionString" connectionString="server=ACADEMY-EA-DB01;database=Employees;uid=sa;password=ILFREIGHTDB01!;" />
sa
```

What is the password for the database user?

```bash
#<add name="myConnectionString" connectionString="server=ACADEMY-EA-DB01;database=Employees;uid=sa;password=ILFREIGHTDB01!;" />
ILFREIGHTDB01!
```
