# Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

### Port Forwarding in Context

`Port forwarding` is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.

***

### SSH Local Port Forwarding

Let's take an example from the below image.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/158/11.png)

Note: Each network diagram presented in this module is designed to illustrate concepts discussed in the associated section. The IP addressing shown in the diagrams will not always match the lab environments exactly. Be sure to focus on understanding the concept, and you will find the diagrams will prove very useful! After reading this section be sure to reference the above image again to reinforce the concepts.

We have our attack host (10.10.15.x) and a target Ubuntu server (10.129.x.x), which we have compromised. We will scan the target Ubuntu server using Nmap to search for open ports.

**Scanning the Pivot Target**

Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sT -p22,3306 10.129.202.64

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-24 12:12 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.202.64
Host is up (0.12s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
3306/tcp closed mysql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.68 seconds
```

The Nmap output shows that the SSH port is open. To access the MySQL service, we can either SSH into the server and access MySQL from inside the Ubuntu server, or we can port forward it to our localhost on port `1234` and access it locally. A benefit of accessing it locally is if we want to execute a remote exploit on the MySQL service, we won't be able to do it without port forwarding. This is due to MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port `3306`. So, we will use the below command to forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu server.

**Executing the Local Port Forward**

Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```shell-session

The `-L` command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port `1234` to `localhost:3306` on the Ubuntu server. By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234. We can use Netstat or Nmap to query our local host on 1234 port to verify whether the MySQL service was forwarded.

**Confirming Port Forward with Netstat**

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ netstat -antp | grep 1234

```

**Confirming Port Forward with Nmap**

Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the `local port:server:port` argument to your ssh command. For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on `8080`.

**Forwarding Multiple Ports**

Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

### Setting up to Pivot

Now, if you type `ifconfig` on the Ubuntu host, you will find that this server has multiple NICs:

* One connected to our attack host (`ens192`)
* One communicating to other hosts within a different network (`ens224`)
* The loopback interface (`lo`).

**Looking for Opportunities to Pivot using ifconfig**

```

Unlike the previous scenario where we knew which port to access, in our current scenario, we don't know which services lie on the other side of the network. So, we can scan smaller ranges of IPs on the network (`172.16.5.1-200`) network or the entire subnet (`172.16.5.0/23`). We cannot perform this scan directly from our attack host because it does not have routes to the `172.16.5.0/23` network. To do this, we will have to perform `dynamic port forwarding` and `pivot` our network packets via the Ubuntu server. We can do this by starting a `SOCKS listener` on our `local host` (personal attack host or Pwnbox) and then configure SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the network (172.16.5.0/23) after connecting to the target host.

This is called `SSH tunneling` over `SOCKS proxy`. SOCKS stands for `Socket Secure`, a protocol that helps communicate with servers where you have firewall restrictions in place. Unlike most cases where you would initiate a connection to connect to a service, in the case of SOCKS, the initial traffic is generated by a SOCKS client, which connects to the SOCKS server controlled by the user who wants to access a service on the client-side. Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client.

This technique is often used to circumvent the restrictions put in place by firewalls, and allow an external entity to bypass the firewall and access a service within the firewalled environment. One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server from `NAT networks`. SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: `SOCKS4` and `SOCKS5`. SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that. Let's take an example of the below image where we have a NAT'd network of 172.16.5.0/23, which we cannot access directly.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/158/22.png)

In the above image, the attack host starts the SSH client and requests the SSH server to allow it to send some TCP data over the ssh socket. The SSH server responds with an acknowledgment, and the SSH client then starts listening on `localhost:9050`. Whatever data you send here will be broadcasted to the entire network (172.16.5.0/23) over SSH. We can use the below command to perform this dynamic port forwarding.

**Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH**

Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

The `-D` argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding. Once we have this enabled, we will require a tool that can route any tool's packets over the port `9050`. We can do this using the tool `proxychains`, which is capable of redirecting TCP connections through TOR, SOCKS, and HTTP/HTTPS proxy servers and also allows us to chain multiple proxy servers together. Using proxychains, we can hide the IP address of the requesting host as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host. Proxychains is often used to force an application's `TCP traffic` to go through hosted proxies like `SOCKS4`/`SOCKS5`, `TOR`, or `HTTP`/`HTTPS` proxies.

To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at `/etc/proxychains.conf`. We can add `socks4 127.0.0.1 9050` to the last line if it is not already there.

**Checking /etc/proxychains.conf**

Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf

# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```

Now when you start Nmap with proxychains using the below command, it will route all the packets of Nmap to the local port 9050, where our SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

**Using Nmap with Proxychains**

Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200

```

This part of packing all your Nmap data using proxychains and forwarding it to a remote server is called `SOCKS tunneling`. One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a `full TCP connect scan` over proxychains. The reason for this is that proxychains cannot understand partial packets. If you send partial packets like half connect scans, it will return incorrect results. We also need to make sure we are aware of the fact that `host-alive` checks may not work against Windows targets because the Windows Defender firewall blocks ICMP requests (traditional pings) by default.

[A full TCP connect scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) without ping on an entire network range will take a long time. So, for this module, we will primarily focus on scanning individual hosts, or smaller ranges of hosts we know are alive, which in this case will be a Windows host at `172.16.5.19`.

We will perform a remote system scan using the below command.

The Nmap scan shows several open ports, one of which is `RDP port` (3389). Similar to the Nmap scan, we can also pivot `msfconsole` via proxychains to perform vulnerable RDP scans using Metasploit auxiliary modules. We can start msfconsole with proxychains.

### Using Metasploit with Proxychains

We can also open Metasploit using proxychains and send all associated traffic through the proxy we have established.

At the bottom of the output above, we can see the RDP port open with the Windows OS version.

Depending on the level of access we have to this host during an assessment, we may try to run an exploit or log in using gathered credentials. For this module, we will log in to the Windows remote host over the SOCKS tunnel. This can be done using `xfreerdp`. The user in our case is `victor,` and the password is `pass@123`

**Using xfreerdp with Proxychains**

Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123

```

The xfreerdp command will require an RDP certificate to be accepted before successfully establishing the session. After accepting it, we should have an RDP session, pivoting via the Ubuntu server.
