# Databases

`Databases` in `msfconsole` are used to keep track of your results. It is no mystery that during even more complex machine assessments, much less entire networks, things can get a little fuzzy and complicated due to the sheer amount of search results, entry points, detected issues, discovered credentials, etc.

This is where Databases come into play. `Msfconsole` has built-in support for the PostgreSQL database system. With it, we have direct, quick, and easy access to scan results with the added ability to import and export results in conjunction with third-party tools. Database entries can also be used to configure Exploit module parameters with the already existing findings directly.

***

### Setting up the Database

First, we must ensure that the PostgreSQL server is up and running on our host machine. To do so, input the following command:

**PostgreSQL Status**

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo service postgresql status

● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Fri 2022-05-06 14:51:30 BST; 3min 51s ago
    Process: 2147 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 2147 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 1ms

May 06 14:51:30 pwnbox-base systemd[1]: Starting PostgreSQL RDBMS...
May 06 14:51:30 pwnbox-base systemd[1]: Finished PostgreSQL RDBMS.
```

**Start PostgreSQL**

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

After starting PostgreSQL, we need to create and initialize the MSF database with `msfdb init`.

**MSF - Initiate a Database**

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo msfdb init

[i] Database already started
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
rake aborted!
NoMethodError: undefined method `without' for #<Bundler::Settings:0x000055dddcf8cba8>
Did you mean? with_options

<SNIP>
```

Sometimes an error can occur if Metasploit is not up to date. This difference that causes the error can happen for several reasons. First, often it helps to update Metasploit again (`apt update`) to solve this problem. Then we can try to reinitialize the MSF database.

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo msfdb init

[i] Database already started
[i] The database appears to be already configured, skipping initialization
```

If the initialization is skipped and Metasploit tells us that the database is already configured, we can recheck the status of the database.

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo msfdb status

● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Mon 2022-05-09 15:19:57 BST; 35min ago
    Process: 2476 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 2476 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 1ms

May 09 15:19:57 pwnbox-base systemd[1]: Starting PostgreSQL RDBMS...

[+] Detected configuration file (/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml)
```

If this error does not appear, which often happens after a fresh installation of Metasploit, then we will see the following when initializing the database:

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo msfdb init

[+] Starting database
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
```

After the database has been initialized, we can start `msfconsole` and connect to the created database simultaneously.

**MSF - Connect to the Initiated Database**

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo msfdb run

[i] Database already started

                .

msf6>
```

If, however, we already have the database configured and are not able to change the password to the MSF username, proceed with these commands:

**MSF - Reinitiate the Database**

Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ msfdb reinit
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cp /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml ~/.msf4/
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo service postgresql restart
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole -q

msf6 > db_status

[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: PostgreSQL.
```

Now, we are good to go. The `msfconsole` also offers integrated help for the database. This gives us a good overview of interacting with and using the database.

**MSF - Database Options**

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > help database

```

***

### Using the Database

With the help of the database, we can manage many different categories and hosts that we have analyzed. Alternatively, the information about them that we have interacted with using Metasploit. These databases can be exported and imported. This is especially useful when we have extensive lists of hosts, loot, notes, and stored vulnerabilities for these hosts. After confirming that the database is successfully connected, we can organize our `Workspaces`.

**Workspaces**

We can think of `Workspaces` the same way we would think of folders in a project. We can segregate the different scan results, hosts, and extracted information by IP, subnet, network, or domain.

To view the current Workspace list, use the `workspace` command. Adding a `-a` or `-d` switch after the command, followed by the workspace's name, will either `add` or `delete` that workspace to the database.

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace

* default
```

Notice that the default Workspace is named `default` and is currently in use according to the `*` symbol. Type the `workspace [name]` command to switch the presently used workspace. Looking back at our example, let us create a workspace for this assessment and select it.

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -a Target_1

[*] Added workspace: Target_1
[*] Workspace: Target_1


msf6 > workspace Target_1 

[*] Workspace: Target_1


msf6 > workspace

  default
* Target_1
```

To see what else we can do with Workspaces, we can use the `workspace -h` command for the help menu related to Workspaces.

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -h

Usage:
    workspace                  List workspaces
    workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
    workspace [name]           Switch workspace
    workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
    workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
    workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
    workspace -r     Rename workspace
    workspace -h               Show this help information
```

***

### Importing Scan Results

Next, let us assume we want to import a `Nmap scan` of a host into our Database's Workspace to understand the target better. We can use the `db_import` command for this. After the import is complete, we can check the presence of the host's information in our database by using the `hosts` and `services` commands. Note that the `.xml` file type is preferred for `db_import`.

**Stored Nmap Scan**

Databases

```shell-session

### Using Nmap Inside MSFconsole

Alternatively, we can use Nmap straight from msfconsole! To scan directly from the console without having to background or exit the process, use the `db_nmap` command.

**MSF - Nmap**

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > db_nmap -sV -sS 10.10.10.8

[*] Nmap: Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-08-17 21:04 UTC

10.10.10.40  49157  tcp    msrpc         open   Microsoft Windows RPC
```

***

### Data Backup

After finishing the session, make sure to back up our data if anything happens with the PostgreSQL service. To do so, use the `db_export` command.

**MSF - DB Export**

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > db_export -h

Usage:
    db_export -f <format> [filename]
    Format can be one of: xml, pwdump
[-] No output file was specified


msf6 > db_export -f xml backup.xml

[*] Starting export of workspace default to backup.xml [ xml ]...
[*] Finished export of workspace default to backup.xml [ xml ]...
```

This data can be imported back to msfconsole later when needed. Other commands related to data retention are the extended use of `hosts`, `services`, and the `creds` and `loot` commands.

***

### Hosts

The `hosts` command displays a database table automatically populated with the host addresses, hostnames, and other information we find about these during our scans and interactions. For example, suppose `msfconsole` is linked with scanner plugins that can perform service and OS detection. In that case, this information should automatically appear in the table once the scans are completed through msfconsole. Again, tools like Nessus, NexPose, or Nmap will help us in these cases.

Hosts can also be manually added as separate entries in this table. After adding our custom hosts, we can also organize the format and structure of the table, add comments, change existing information, and more.

**MSF - Stored Hosts**

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > hosts -h

Usage: hosts [ options ] [addr1 addr2 ...]

OPTIONS:
  -a,--add          Add the hosts instead of searching
  -d,--delete       Delete the hosts instead of searching
  -c <col1,col2>    Only show the given columns (see list below)
  -C <col1,col2>    Only show the given columns until the next restart (see list below)
  -h,--help         Show this help information
  -u,--up           Only show hosts which are up
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in CSV format
  -O <column>       Order rows by specified column number
  -R,--rhosts       Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,--search       Search string to filter by
  -i,--info         Change the info of a host
  -n,--name         Change the name of a host
  -m,--comment      Change the comment of a host
  -t,--tag          Add or specify a tag to a range of hosts

Available columns: address, arch, comm, comments, created_at, cred_count, detected_arch, exploit_attempt_count, host_detail_count, info, mac, name, note_count, os_family, os_flavor, os_lang, os_name, os_sp, purpose, scope, service_count, state, updated_at, virtual_host, vuln_count, tags
```

***

### Services

The `services` command functions the same way as the previous one. It contains a table with descriptions and information on services discovered during scans or interactions. In the same way as the command above, the entries here are highly customizable.

**MSF - Stored Services of Hosts**

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > services -h

Usage: services [-h] [-u] [-a] [-r <proto>] [-p <port1,port2>] [-s <name1,name2>] [-o <filename>] [addr1 addr2 ...]

  -a,--add          Add the services instead of searching
  -d,--delete       Delete the services instead of searching
  -c <col1,col2>    Only show the given columns
  -h,--help         Show this help information
  -s <name>         Name of the service to add
  -p <port>         Search for a list of ports
  -r <protocol>     Protocol type of the service being added [tcp|udp]
  -u,--up           Only show services which are up
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in csv format
  -O <column>       Order rows by specified column number
  -R,--rhosts       Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,--search       Search string to filter by
  -U,--update       Update data for existing service

Available columns: created_at, info, name, port, proto, state, updated_at
```

***

### Credentials

The `creds` command allows you to visualize the credentials gathered during your interactions with the target host. We can also add credentials manually, match existing credentials with port specifications, add descriptions, etc.

**MSF - Stored Credentials**

Databases

```shell-session
msf6 > creds -h

With no sub-command, list credentials. If an address range is
given, show only credentials with logins on hosts within that
range.

Usage - Listing credentials:
  creds [filter options] [address range]

Usage - Adding credentials:
  creds add uses the following named parameters.
    user      :  Public, usually a username
    password  :  Private, private_type Password.
    ntlm      :  Private, private_type NTLM Hash.
    Postgres  :  Private, private_type Postgres MD5
    ssh-key   :  Private, private_type SSH key, must be a file path.
    hash      :  Private, private_type Nonreplayable hash
    jtr       :  Private, private_type John the Ripper hash type.
    realm     :  Realm, 
    realm-type:  Realm, realm_type (domain db2db sid pgdb rsync wildcard), defaults to domain.

Examples: Adding
   # Add a user, password and realm
   creds add user:admin password:notpassword realm:workgroup
   # Add a user and password
   creds add user:guest password:'guest password'
   # Add a password
   creds add password:'password without username'
   # Add a user with an NTLMHash
   creds add user:admin ntlm:E2FC15074BF7751DD408E6B105741864:A1074A69B1BDE45403AB680504BBDD1A
   # Add a NTLMHash
   creds add ntlm:E2FC15074BF7751DD408E6B105741864:A1074A69B1BDE45403AB680504BBDD1A
   # Add a Postgres MD5
   creds add user:postgres postgres:md5be86a79bf2043622d58d5453c47d4860
   # Add a user with an SSH key
   creds add user:sshadmin ssh-key:/path/to/id_rsa
   # Add a user and a NonReplayableHash
   creds add user:other hash:d19c32489b870735b5f587d76b934283 jtr:md5
   # Add a NonReplayableHash
   creds add hash:d19c32489b870735b5f587d76b934283

General options
  -h,--help             Show this help information
  -o <file>             Send output to a file in csv/jtr (john the ripper) format.
                        If the file name ends in '.jtr', that format will be used.
                        If file name ends in '.hcat', the hashcat format will be used.
                        CSV by default.
  -d,--delete           Delete one or more credentials

Filter options for listing
  -P,--password <text>  List passwords that match this text
  -p,--port <portspec>  List creds with logins on services matching this port spec
  -s <svc names>        List creds matching comma-separated service names
  -u,--user <text>      List users that match this text
  -t,--type <type>      List creds that match the following types: password,ntlm,hash
  -O,--origins <IP>     List creds that match these origins
  -R,--rhosts           Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -v,--verbose          Don't truncate long password hashes

Examples, John the Ripper hash types:

### Loot

The `loot` command works in conjunction with the command above to offer you an at-a-glance list of owned services and users. The loot, in this case, refers to hash dumps from different system types, namely hashes, passwd, shadow, and more.
