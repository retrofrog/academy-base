# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

To better learn how we can efficiently and quietly attack a target, we first need to understand better how that target is defended. We are introduced to two new terms:

* Endpoint protection
* Perimeter protection

***

### Endpoint Protection

`Endpoint protection` refers to any localized device or service whose sole purpose is to protect a single host on the network. The host can be a personal computer, a corporate workstation, or a server in a network's De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`).

Endpoint protection usually comes in the form of software packs which include `Antivirus Protection`, `Antimalware Protection` (this includes bloatware, spyware, adware, scareware, ransomware), `Firewall`, and `Anti-DDOS` all in one, under the same software package. We are better familiarized with this form than the latter, as most of us are running endpoint protection software on our PCs at home or the workstations at our workplace. Avast, Nod32, Malwarebytes, and BitDefender are just some current names.

***

**Perimeter Protection**

`Perimeter protection` usually comes in physical or virtualized devices on the network perimeter edge. These `edge devices` themselves provide access `inside` of the network from the `outside`, in other terms, from `public` to `private`.

Between these two zones, on some occasions, we will also find a third one, called the De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`), which was mentioned previously. This is a `lower-security policy level` zone than the `inside networks'` one, but with a higher `trust level` than the `outside zone`, which is the vast Internet. This is the virtual space where public-facing servers are housed, which push and pull data for public clients from the Internet but are also managed from the inside and updated with patches, information, and other data to keep the served information up to date and satisfy the customers of the servers.

***

### Security Policies

Security policies are the drive behind every well-maintained security posture of any network. They function the same way as ACL (Access Control Lists) do for anyone familiar with the Cisco CCNA educational material. They are essentially a list of `allow` and `deny` statements that dictate how traffic or files can exist within a network boundary. Multiple lists can act upon multiple network parts, allowing for flexibility within a configuration. These lists can also target different features of the network and hosts, depending on where they reside:

* Network Traffic Policies
* Application Policies
* User Access Control Policies
* File Management Policies
* DDoS Protection Policies
* Others

While not all of these categories above might have the words "Security Policy" attached to them, all of the security mechanisms around them operate on the same basic principle, the `allow` and `deny` entries. The only difference is the object target they refer to and apply to. So the question remains, how do we match events in the network with these rules so that the actions mentioned earlier can be taken?

There are multiple ways to match an event or object with a security policy entry:

| **Security Policy**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Signature-based Detection`                 | The operation of packets in the network and comparison with pre-built and pre-ordained attack patterns known as signatures. Any 100% match against these signatures will generate alarms.                                                                                                                                         |
| `Heuristic / Statistical Anomaly Detection` | Behavioral comparison against an established baseline included modus-operandi signatures for known APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats). The baseline will identify the norm for the network and what protocols are commonly used. Any deviation from the maximum threshold will generate alarms.                                   |
| `Stateful Protocol Analysis Detection`      | Recognizing the divergence of protocols stated by event comparison using pre-built profiles of generally accepted definitions of non-malicious activity.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Live-monitoring and Alerting (SOC-based)`  | A team of analysts in a dedicated, in-house, or leased SOC (Security Operations Center) use live-feed software to monitor network activity and intermediate alarming systems for any potential threats, either deciding themselves if the threat should be actioned upon or letting the automated mechanisms take action instead. |

### Evasion Techniques

Most host-based anti-virus software nowadays relies mainly on `Signature-based Detection` to identify aspects of malicious code present in a software sample. These signatures are placed inside the Antivirus Engine, where they are subsequently used to scan storage space and running processes for any matches. When a piece of unknown software lands on a partition and is matched by the Antivirus software, most Anti-viruses quarantine the malicious program and kill the running process.

How do we circumvent all this heat? We play along with it. The examples shown in the `Encoders` section show that simply encoding payloads using different encoding schemes with multiple iterations is not enough for all AV products. Moreover, merely establishing a channel of communication between the attacker and the victim can raise some alarms with the current capabilities of IDS/IPS products out there.

However, with the MSF6 release, msfconsole can tunnel AES-encrypted communication from any Meterpreter shell back to the attacker host, successfully encrypting the traffic as the payload is sent to the victim host. This mostly takes care of the network-based IDS/IPS. In some rare cases, we might be met with very strict traffic rulesets that flag our connection based on the sender's IP address. The only way to circumvent this is to find the services being let through. An excellent example of this would be the Equifax hack of 2017, where malicious hackers have abused the Apache Struts vulnerability to access a network of critical data servers. DNS exfiltration techniques were used to slowly siphon data out of the network and into the hackers' domain without being noticed for months. To learn more about this attack, visit the links below:

* [US Government Post-Mortem Report on the Equifax Hack](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-government-releases-post-mortem-report-on-equifax-hack/)
* [Protecting from DNS Exfiltration](https://www.darkreading.com/risk/tips-to-protect-the-dns-from-data-exfiltration/a/d-id/1330411)
* [Stoping Data Exfil and Malware Spread through DNS](https://www.infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/infoblox-whitepaper-stopping-data-exfiltration-and-malware-spread-through-dns.pdf)

Returning to msfconsole, its capability to now sustain AES-encrypted tunnels, together with Meterpreter's feature of running in memory, raises our capability by a margin. However, we still have the issue of what happens to a payload once it reaches its destination, before it is run and placed into memory. This file could be fingerprinted for its signature, matched against the database, and blocked, together with our chances of accessing the target. We can also be sure that AV software developers are looking at msfconsole modules and capabilities to add the resulting code and files to their signature database, resulting in most if not all of the default payloads being immediately shut down by AV software nowadays.

We are in luck because `msfvenom` offers the option of using executable templates. This allows us to use some pre-set templates for executable files, inject our payload into them (no pun intended), and use `any` executable as a platform from which we can launch our attack. We can embed the shellcode into any installer, package, or program that we have at hand, hiding the payload shellcode deep within the legitimate code of the actual product. This greatly obfuscates our malicious code and, more importantly, lowers our detection chances. There are many valid combinations between actual, legitimate executable files, our different encoding schemes (and their iterations), and our different payload shellcode variants. This generates what is called a backdoored executable.

Take a look at the snippet below to understand how msfvenom can embed payloads into any executable file:

```

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ls

Pictures-of-cats.tar.gz  TeamViewer_Setup.exe  Cake_recipes
```

For the most part, when a target launches a backdoored executable, nothing will appear to happen, which can raise suspicions in some cases. To improve our chances, we need to trigger the continuation of the normal execution of the launched application while pulling the payload in a separate thread from the main application. We do so with the `-k` flag as it appears above. However, even with the `-k` flag running, the target will only notice the running backdoor if they launch the backdoored executable template from a CLI environment. If they do so, a separate window will pop up with the payload, which will not close until we finish running the payload session interaction on the target.

***

### Archives

Archiving a piece of information such as a file, folder, script, executable, picture, or document and placing a password on the archive bypasses a lot of common anti-virus signatures today. However, the downside of this process is that they will be raised as notifications in the AV alarm dashboard as being unable to be scanned due to being locked with a password. An administrator can choose to manually inspect these archives to determine if they are malicious or not.

Now, try archiving it two times, passwording both archives upon creation, and removing the `.rar`/`.zip`/`.7z` extension from their names. For this purpose, we can install the [RAR utility](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) from RARLabs, which works precisely like WinRAR on Windows.

### Packers

The term `Packer` refers to the result of an `executable compression` process where the payload is packed together with an executable program and with the decompression code in one single file. When run, the decompression code returns the backdoored executable to its original state, allowing for yet another layer of protection against file scanning mechanisms on target hosts. This process takes place transparently for the compressed executable to be run the same way as the original executable while retaining all of the original functionality. In addition, msfvenom provides the ability to compress and change the file structure of a backdoored executable and encrypt the underlying process structure.

A list of popular packer software:

### Exploit Coding

When coding our exploit or porting a pre-existing one over to the Framework, it is good to ensure that the exploit code is not easily identifiable by security measures implemented on the target system.

For example, a typical `Buffer Overflow` exploit might be easily distinguished from regular traffic traveling over the network due to its hexadecimal buffer patterns. IDS / IPS placements can check the traffic towards the target machine and notice specific overused patterns for exploiting code.

When assembling our exploit code, randomization can help add some variation to those patterns, which will break the IPS / IDS database signatures for well-known exploit buffers. This can be done by inputting an `Offset` switch inside the code for the msfconsole module:

Code: ruby

```ruby
'Targets' =>
[
 	[ 'Windows 2000 SP4 English', { 'Ret' => 0x77e14c29, 'Offset' => 5093 } ],
],
```

Besides the BoF code, one should always avoid using obvious NOP sleds where the shellcode should land after the overflow is completed. Please note that the BoF code's purpose is to crash the service running on the target machine, while the NOP sled is the allocated memory where our shellcode (the payload) is inserted. IPS/IDS entities regularly check both of these, so it is good to test our custom exploit code against a sandbox environment before deploying it on the client network. Of course, we might only have one chance to do this correctly during an assessment.

For more information about exploit coding, we recommend checking out the [Metasploit - The Penetration Tester's Guide](https://nostarch.com/metasploit) book from No Starch Press. They delve into quite some detail about creating our exploits for the Framework.

### Recompiling Meterpreter from Source Code

Intrusion Prevention Systems and Antivirus Engines are the most common defender tools that can shoot down an initial foothold on the target. These mainly function on signatures of the whole malicious file or the stub stage.

### A Note on Evasion

This section covers evasion at a high level. Be on the lookout for later modules that will dig deeper into the theory and practical knowledge needed to perform evasion more effectively. It is worth trying some of these techniques out on older HTB machines or installing a VM with older versions of Windows Defender or free AV engines, and practicing evasion skills. This is a vast topic that cannot be covered adequately in a single section.
