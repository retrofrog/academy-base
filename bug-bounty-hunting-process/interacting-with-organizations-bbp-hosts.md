# Interacting with Organizations/BBP Hosts

Suppose that you have submitted a bug report. How should you interact with the security/triage team after that?

Well, to begin with, do not interact with them. Allow the security/triage team some time to process your report, validate your finding, and maybe ask questions. Some bug bounty programs/platforms include vendor response SLAs or response efficiency metrics, which can give you an idea of how long it can take for them to get back to a submission. Also, make sure that you do not spam the security/triage team within a short period of time.

If the security/triage team does not get back to you in a reasonable amount of time, then if the submission was through a bug bounty platform, you can contact [Mediation](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker-mediation.html).

Once the security/triage team gets back to you, note the team member's username and tag them in any future communications since they will probably be dealing with your submission. Do not interact with the security/triage team through any unofficial communication channel (social media etc.)!

A professional bug report should be accompanied by professional communication. Remain calm and interact with the security/triage team as a security professional would.

During your interaction with the security/triage team, there could be disagreements about the severity of the bug or the bounty. A bug's impact and severity play a significant role during the bounty amount assignment. In the case of such a disagreement, proceed as follows.

* Explain your rationale for choosing this severity score and guide the security/triage team through each metric value you specified in the CVSS calculator. Eventually, you will come to an agreement.
* Go over the bug bounty program's policy and scope and ensure that your submission complies with both. Also, make sure that the bounty amount resembles the policy of the bug bounty program.
* If none of the above was fruitful, contact mediation or a similar platform service.
