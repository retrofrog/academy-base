# Catching Files over HTTP/S

### HTTP/S

Web transfer is the most common way most people transfer files because `HTTP`/`HTTPS` are the most common protocols allowed through firewalls. Another immense benefit is that, in many cases, the file will be encrypted in transit. There is nothing worse than being on a penetration test, and a client's network IDS picks up on a sensitive file being transferred over plaintext and having them ask why we sent a password to our cloud server without using encryption.

We have already discussed using the Python3 [uploadserver module](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver) to set up a web server with upload capabilities, but we can also use Apache or Nginx. This section will cover creating a secure web server for file upload operations.

### Nginx - Enabling PUT

A good alternative for transferring files to `Apache` is [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) because the configuration is less complicated, and the module system does not lead to security issues as `Apache` can.

When allowing `HTTP` uploads, it is critical to be 100% positive that users cannot upload web shells and execute them. `Apache` makes it easy to shoot ourselves in the foot with this, as the `PHP` module loves to execute anything ending in `PHP`. Configuring `Nginx` to use PHP is nowhere near as simple.

**Create a Directory to Handle Uploaded Files**

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
```

**Change the Owner to www-data**

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
```

**Create Nginx Configuration File**

Create the Nginx configuration file by creating the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf` with the contents:

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
server {
    listen 9001;
    
    location /SecretUploadDirectory/ {
        root    /var/www/uploads;
        dav_methods PUT;
    }
}
```

**Symlink our Site to the sites-enabled Directory**

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session

AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

**Start Nginx**

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

If we get any error messages, check `/var/log/nginx/error.log`. If using Pwnbox, we will see port 80 is already in use.

**Verifying Errors**

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ tail -2 `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

2020/11/17 16:11:56 [emerg] 5679#5679: bind() to 0.0.0.0:`80` failed (98: A`ddress already in use`)
2020/11/17 16:11:56 [emerg] 5679#5679: still could not bind()
```

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ss -lnpt | grep `80`

LISTEN 0      100          0.0.0.0:80        0.0.0.0:*    users:(("python",pid=`2811`,fd=3),("python",pid=2070,fd=3),("python",pid=1968,fd=3),("python",pid=1856,fd=3))
```

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ps -ef | grep `2811`

user65      2811    1856  0 16:05 ?        00:00:04 `python -m websockify 80 localhost:5901 -D`
root        6720    2226  0 16:14 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto 2811
```

We see there is already a module listening on port 80. To get around this, we can remove the default Nginx configuration, which binds on port 80.

**Remove NginxDefault Configuration**

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Now we can test uploading by using `cURL` to send a `PUT` request. In the below example, we will upload the `/etc/passwd` file to the server and call it users.txt

**Upload File Using cURL**

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ curl -T /etc/passwd http://localhost:9001/SecretUploadDirectory/users.txt
```

Catching Files over HTTP/S

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ tail -1 /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory/users.txt 

user65:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/user65:/bin/bash
```

Once we have this working, a good test is to ensure the directory listing is not enabled by navigating to `http://localhost/SecretUploadDirectory`. By default, with `Apache`, if we hit a directory without an index file (index.html), it will list all the files. This is bad for our use case of exfilling files because most files are sensitive by nature, and we want to do our best to hide them. Thanks to `Nginx` being minimal, features like that are not enabled by default.

### Using Built-in Tools

In the next section, we'll introduce the topic of "Living off the Land" or using built-in Windows and Linux utilities to perform file transfer activities. We will repeatedly come back to this concept throughout the modules in the Penetration Tester path when covering tasks such as Windows and Linux privilege escalation and Active Directory enumeration and exploitation.
