# Getting Started with SQLMap

Upon starting using SQLMap, the first stop for new users is usually the program's help message. To help new users, there are two levels of help message listing:

* `Basic Listing` shows only the basic options and switches, sufficient in most cases (switch `-h`):

Getting Started with SQLMap

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sqlmap -h
        ___
       __H__
 ___ ___[']_____ ___ ___  {1.4.9#stable}
|_ -| . ["]     | .'| . |
|___|_  [.]_|_|_|__,|  _|
      |_|V...       |_|   http://sqlmap.org

Usage: python3 sqlmap [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            Show basic help message and exit
  -hh                   Show advanced help message and exit
  --version             Show program's version number and exit
  -v VERBOSE            Verbosity level: 0-6 (default 1)

  Target:
    At least one of these options has to be provided to define the
    target(s)

    -u URL, --url=URL   Target URL (e.g. "http://www.site.com/vuln.php?id=1")
    -g GOOGLEDORK       Process Google dork results as target URLs
...SNIP...
```

* `Advanced Listing` shows all options and switches (switch `-hh`):

  -v VERBOSE            Verbosity level: 0-6 (default 1)

  Target:
    At least one of these options has to be provided to define the
    target(s)

    -u URL, --url=URL   Target URL (e.g. "http://www.site.com/vuln.php?id=1")
    -d DIRECT           Connection string for direct database connection
    -l LOGFILE          Parse target(s) from Burp or WebScarab proxy log file
    -m BULKFILE         Scan multiple targets given in a textual file
    -r REQUESTFILE      Load HTTP request from a file
    -g GOOGLEDORK       Process Google dork results as target URLs
    -c CONFIGFILE       Load options from a configuration INI file

  Request:
    These options can be used to specify how to connect to the target URL

    -A AGENT, --user..  HTTP User-Agent header value
    -H HEADER, --hea..  Extra header (e.g. "X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1")
    --method=METHOD     Force usage of given HTTP method (e.g. PUT)
    --data=DATA         Data string to be sent through POST (e.g. "id=1")
    --param-del=PARA..  Character used for splitting parameter values (e.g. &)
    --cookie=COOKIE     HTTP Cookie header value (e.g. "PHPSESSID=a8d127e..")
    --cookie-del=COO..  Character used for splitting cookie values (e.g. ;)
...SNIP...
```

For more details, users are advised to consult the project's [wiki](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Usage), as it represents the official manual for SQLMap's usage.

### Basic Scenario

In a simple scenario, a penetration tester accesses the web page that accepts user input via a `GET` parameter (e.g., `id`). They then want to test if the web page is affected by the SQL injection vulnerability. If so, they would want to exploit it, retrieve as much information as possible from the back-end database, or even try to access the underlying file system and execute OS commands. An example SQLi vulnerable PHP code for this scenario would look as follows:

Code: php

```php
$link = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database, 3306);
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $_GET["id"] . " LIMIT 0, 1";
$result = mysqli_query($link, $sql);
if (!$result)
    die("<b>SQL error:</b> ". mysqli_error($link) . "<br>\n");
```

As error reporting is enabled for the vulnerable SQL query, there will be a database error returned as part of the web-server response in case of any SQL query execution problems. Such cases ease the process of SQLi detection, especially in case of manual parameter value tampering, as the resulting errors are easily recognized:

To run SQLMap against this example, located at the example URL `http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1`, would look like the following:

```shell-session

Note: in this case, option '-u' is used to provide the target URL, while the switch '--batch' is used for skipping any required user-input, by automatically choosing using the default option.
