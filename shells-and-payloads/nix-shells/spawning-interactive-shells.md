# Spawning Interactive Shells

***

At the end of the last section, we established a shell session with the target. Initially, our shell was limited (sometimes referred to as a jail shell), so we used python to spawn a TTY bourne shell to give us access to more commands and a prompt to work from. This will likely be a situation we find ourselves in more and more as we practice on Hack The Box and in the real world on engagements.

There may be times that we land on a system with a limited shell, and Python is not installed. In these cases, it's good to know that we could use several different methods to spawn an interactive shell. Let's examine some of them.

Know that whenever we see `/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash`, this could also be replaced with the binary associated with the shell interpreter language present on that system. With most Linux systems, we will likely come across `bourne shell` (`/bin/sh`) and `bourne again shell` (`/bin/bash`) present on the system natively.

### /bin/sh -i

This command will execute the shell interpreter specified in the path in interactive mode (`-i`).

**Interactive**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
/bin/sh -i
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-4.2$
```

***

### Perl

If the programming language [Perl](https://www.perl.org) is present on the system, these commands will execute the shell interpreter specified.

**Perl To Shell**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.

***

### Ruby

If the programming language [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is present on the system, this command will execute the shell interpreter specified:

**Ruby To Shell**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.

***

### Lua

If the programming language [Lua](https://www.lua.org) is present on the system, we can use the `os.execute` method to execute the shell interpreter specified using the full command below:

**Lua To Shell**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.

***

### AWK

[AWK](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/awk.1p.html) is a C-like pattern scanning and processing language present on most UNIX/Linux-based systems, widely used by developers and sysadmins to generate reports. It can also be used to spawn an interactive shell. This is shown in the short awk script below:

**AWK To Shell**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
```

***

### Find

[Find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) is a command present on most Unix/Linux systems widely used to search for & through files and directories using various criteria. It can also be used to execute applications and invoke a shell interpreter.

**Using Find For A Shell**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
```

This use of the find command is searching for any file listed after the `-name` option, then it executes `awk` (`/bin/awk`) and runs the same script we discussed in the awk section to execute a shell interpreter.

***

### Using Exec To Launch A Shell

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
```

This use of the find command uses the execute option (`-exec`) to initiate the shell interpreter directly. If `find` can't find the specified file, then no shell will be attained.

***

### VIM

Yes, we can set the shell interpreter language from within the popular command-line-based text-editor `VIM`. This is a very niche situation we would find ourselves in to need to use this method, but it is good to know just in case.

**Vim To Shell**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```

**Vim Escape**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
vim
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
```

***

### Execution Permissions Considerations

In addition to knowing about all the options listed above, we should be mindful of the permissions we have with the shell session's account. We can always attempt to run this command to list the file properties and permissions our account has over any given file or binary:

**Permissions**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
ls -la <path/to/fileorbinary>
```

We can also attempt to run this command to check what `sudo` permissions the account we landed on has:

**Sudo -l**

Spawning Interactive Shells

```shell-session
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for apache on ILF-WebSrv:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User apache may run the following commands on ILF-WebSrv:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

The sudo -l command above will need a stable interactive shell to run. If you are not in a full shell or sitting in an unstable shell, you may not get any return from it. Not only will considering permissions allow us to see what commands we can execute, but it may also start to give us an idea of potential vectors that will allow us to escalate privileges.
