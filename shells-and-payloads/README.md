# Shells & Payloads

## Shells Jack Us In, Payloads Deliver Us Shells

A `shell` is a program that provides a computer user with an interface to input instructions into the system and view text output (Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell, for example). As penetration testers and information security professionals, a shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host. We may have heard or read the following phrases used by people discussing an engagement or a recent practice session:

* `"I caught a shell."`
* `"I popped a shell!"`
* `"I dropped into a shell!"`
* `"I'm in!"`

Typically these phrases translate to the understanding that this person has successfully exploited a vulnerability on a system and has been able to gain remote control of the shell on the target computer's operating system. This is a common goal a penetration tester will have when attempting to access a vulnerable machine. We will notice that most of this module will focus on what comes after enumeration and identification of promising exploits.

### Why Get a Shell?

Remember that the shell gives us direct access to the `OS`, `system commands`, and `file system`. So if we gain access, we can start enumerating the system for vectors that may allow us to escalate privileges, pivot, transfer files, and more. If we don't establish a shell session, we are pretty limited on how far we can get on a target machine.

Establishing a shell also allows us to maintain persistence on the system, giving us more time to work. It can make it easier to use our `attack tools`, `exfiltrate data`, `gather`, `store` and `document` all the details of our attack, as we will soon see in the proceeding demonstrations. It's important to note that establishing a shell almost always means we are accessing the CLI of the OS, and this can make us harder to notice than if we were remotely accessing a graphical shell over [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual\_Network\_Computing) or [RDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-remote-desktop-protocol/). Another significant benefit of becoming skilled with command-line interfaces is that they can be `harder to detect than graphical shells`, `faster to navigate the OS`, and `easier to automate our actions`. We view shells through the lens of the following perspectives throughout this module:

| **Perspective**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Computing`                   | The text-based userland environment that is utilized to administer tasks and submit instructions on a PC. Think Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Exploitation` `&` `Security` | A shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host. An example would be triggering [EternalBlue](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Security-Primer-EternalBlue.pdf) on a Windows host to gain access to the cmd-prompt on a host remotely.                                                           |
| `Web`                         | This is a bit different. A web shell is much like a standard shell, except it exploits a vulnerability (often the ability to upload a file or script) that provides the attacker with a way to issue instructions, read and access files, and potentially perform destructive actions to the underlying host. Control of the web shell is often done by calling the script within a browser window. |

### Payloads Deliver us Shells

Within the IT industry as a whole, a `payload` can be defined in a few different ways:

* `Networking`: The encapsulated data portion of a packet traversing modern computer networks.
* `Basic Computing`: A payload is the portion of an instruction set that defines the action to be taken. Headers and protocol information removed.
* `Programming`: The data portion referenced or carried by the programming language instruction.
* `Exploitation & Security`: A payload is `code` crafted with the intent to exploit a vulnerability on a computer system. The term payload can describe various types of malware, including but not limited to ransomware.

In this module, we will be working with many different types of `payloads` and delivery methods within the context of granting ourselves access to a host and establishing `remote shell` sessions with vulnerable systems.
