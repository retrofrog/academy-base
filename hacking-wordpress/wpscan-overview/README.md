# WPScan Overview

### Using WPScan

[WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) is an automated WordPress scanner and enumeration tool. It determines if the various themes and plugins used by a WordPress site are outdated or vulnerable. It is installed by default on Parrot OS but can also be installed manually with `gem`.

WPScan Overview

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ gem install wpscan
```

Once the installation completes, we can issue a command such as `wpscan --hh` to verify the installation. This command will show us the usage menu with all of the available command-line switches.

There are various enumeration options that can be specified, such as vulnerable plugins, all plugins, user enumeration, and more. It is important to understand all of the options available to us and fine-tune the scanner depending on the goal (i.e., are we just interested to see if the WordPress site is using any vulnerable plugins, do we need to perform a full audit of all aspects of the site or are we just interested in creating a user list to use in a brute force password guessing attack?).

WPScan can pull in vulnerability information from external sources to enhance our scans. We can obtain an API token from [WPVulnDB](https://wpvulndb.com), which is used by WPScan to scan for vulnerability and exploit proof of concepts (POC) and reports. The free plan allows up to 50 requests per day. To use the WPVulnDB database, just create an account and copy the API token from the users page. This token can then be supplied to WPScan using the `--api-token` parameter.

Review the various WPScan options using the below Parrot instance by opening a shell and issuing the command `wpscan --hh`.
