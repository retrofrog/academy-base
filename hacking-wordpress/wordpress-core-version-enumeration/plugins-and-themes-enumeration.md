# Plugins and Themes Enumeration

We can also find information about the installed plugins by reviewing the source code manually by inspecting the page source or filtering for the information using `cURL` and other command-line utilities.

The response headers may also contain version numbers for specific plugins.

However, not all installed plugins and themes can be discovered passively. In this case, we have to send requests to the server actively to enumerate them. We can do this by sending a GET request that points to a directory or file that may exist on the server. If the directory or file does exist, we will either gain access to the directory or file or will receive a redirect response from the webserver, indicating that the content does exist. However, we do not have direct access to it.

**Plugins Active Enumeration**

Plugins and Themes Enumeration

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:08:23 GMT

Location: http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/
Content-Length: 356
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

If the content does not exist, we will receive a `404 Not Found error`.

The same applies to installed themes.

To speed up enumeration, we could also write a simple bash script or use a tool such as `wfuzz` or `WPScan`, which automate the process.
