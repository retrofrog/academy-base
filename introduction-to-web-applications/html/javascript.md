# JavaScript

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is one of the most used languages in the world. It is mostly used for web development and mobile development. `JavaScript` is usually used on the front end of an application to be executed within a browser. Still, there are implementations of back end JavaScript used to develop entire web applications, like [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

While `HTML` and `CSS` are mainly in charge of how a web page looks, `JavaScript` is usually used to control any functionality that the front end web page requires. Without `JavaScript`, a web page would be mostly static and would not have much functionality or interactive elements.

**Example**

Within the page source code, `JavaScript` code is loaded with the `<script>` tag, as follows:

Code: html

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
..JavaScript code..
</script>
```

A web page can also load remote `JavaScript` code with `src` and the script's link, as follows:

Code: html

```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

An example of basic use of `JavaScript` within a web page is the following:

Code: javascript

```javascript
document.getElementById("button1").innerHTML = "Changed Text!";
```

The above example changes the content of the `button1` HTML element. From here on, there are many more advanced uses of `JavaScript` on a web page. The following shows an example of what the above `JavaScript` code would do when linked to a button click:

As with HTML, there are many sites available online to experiment with `JavaScript`. One example is [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) which can be used to test `JavaScript`, `CSS`, and `HTML` and save code snippets. `JavaScript` is an advanced language, and its syntax is not as simple as `HTML` or `CSS`.

### Usage

Most common web applications heavily rely on `JavaScript` to drive all needed functionality on the web page, like updating the web page view in real-time, dynamically updating content in real-time, accepting and processing user input, and many other potential functionalities.

`JavaScript` is also used to automate complex processes and perform HTTP requests to interact with the back end components and send and retrieve data, through technologies like [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax\_\(programming\)).

In addition to automation, `JavaScript` is also often used alongside `CSS`, as previously mentioned, to drive advanced animations that would not be possible with `CSS` alone. Whenever we visit an interactive and dynamic web page that uses many advanced and visually appealing animations, we are seeing the result of active `JavaScript` code running on our browser.

All modern web browsers are equipped with `JavaScript` engines that can execute `JavaScript` code on the client-side without relying on the back end webserver to update the page. This makes using `JavaScript` a very fast way to achieve a large number of processes quickly.

### Frameworks

As web applications become more advanced, it may be inefficient to use pure `JavaScript` to develop an entire web application from scratch. This is why a host of `JavaScript` frameworks have been introduced to improve the experience of web application development.

These platforms introduce libraries that make it very simple to re-create advanced functionalities, like user login and user registration, and they introduce new technologies based on existing ones, like the use of dynamically changing `HTML` code, instead of using static `HTML` code.

These platforms either use `JavaScript` as their programming language or use an implementation of `JavaScript` that compiles its code into `JavaScript` code.

Some of the most common front end `JavaScript` frameworks are:

* [Angular](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular\_intro.asp)
* [React](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react\_intro.asp)
* [Vue](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis\_vue.asp)
* [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/)
