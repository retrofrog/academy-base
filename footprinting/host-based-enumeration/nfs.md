# NFS

`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network\_File\_System) is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. While NFS protocol version 3.0 (`NFSv3`), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with `NFSv4`. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.

| **Version** | **Features**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NFSv2`     | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `NFSv3`     | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.                                                                                                                                       |
| `NFSv4`     | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol. |

NFS version 4.1 ([RFC 8881](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8881)) aims to provide protocol support to leverage cluster server deployments, including the ability to provide scalable parallel access to files distributed across multiple servers (pNFS extension). In addition, NFSv4.1 includes a session trunking mechanism, also known as NFS multipathing. A significant advantage of NFSv4 over its predecessors is that only one UDP or TCP port `2049` is used to run the service, which simplifies the use of the protocol across firewalls.

NFS is based on the [Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\_RPC) (`ONC-RPC`/`SUN-RPC`) protocol exposed on `TCP` and `UDP` ports `111`, which uses [External Data Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External\_Data\_Representation) (`XDR`) for the system-independent exchange of data. The NFS protocol has `no` mechanism for `authentication` or `authorization`. Instead, authentication is completely shifted to the RPC protocol's options. The authorization is derived from the available file system information. In this process, the server is responsible for translating the client's user information into the file system's format and converting the corresponding authorization details into the required UNIX syntax as accurately as possible.

The most common authentication is via UNIX `UID`/`GID` and `group memberships`, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol. One problem is that the client and server do not necessarily have to have the same mappings of UID/GID to users and groups, and the server does not need to do anything further. No further checks can be made on the part of the server. This is why NFS should only be used with this authentication method in trusted networks.

***

### Default Configuration

NFS is not difficult to configure because there are not as many options as FTP or SMB have. The `/etc/exports` file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients. The [NFS Exports Table](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/exports.5.html) shows which options it accepts and thus indicates which options are available to us.

**Exports File**

NFS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

The default `exports` file also contains some examples of configuring NFS shares. First, the folder is specified and made available to others, and then the rights they will have on this NFS share are connected to a host or a subnet. Finally, additional options can be added to the hosts or subnets.

| **Option**         | **Description**                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rw`               | Read and write permissions.                                                                                                                 |
| `ro`               | Read only permissions.                                                                                                                      |
| `sync`             | Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)                                                                                                   |
| `async`            | Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)                                                                                                  |
| `secure`           | Ports above 1024 will not be used.                                                                                                          |
| `insecure`         | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                                              |
| `no_subtree_check` | This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.                                                                                    |
| `root_squash`      | Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents `root` from accessing files on an NFS mount. |

Let us create such an entry for test purposes and play around with the settings.

**ExportFS**

NFS

```shell-session
root@nfs:~# echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
root@nfs:~# systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 
root@nfs:~# exportfs

/mnt/nfs      	10.129.14.0/24
```

We have shared the folder `/mnt/nfs` to the subnet `10.129.14.0/24` with the setting shown above. This means that all hosts on the network will be able to mount this NFS share and inspect the contents of this folder.

***

### Dangerous Settings

However, even with NFS, some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure. Here are some of them listed:

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rw`             | Read and write permissions.                                                                                          |
| `insecure`       | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                       |
| `nohide`         | If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry. |
| `no_root_squash` | All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.                                                               |

It is highly recommended to create a local VM and experiment with the settings. We will discover methods that will show us how the NFS server is configured. For this, we can create several folders and assign different options to each one. Then we can inspect them and see what settings can have what effect on the NFS share and its permissions and the enumeration process.

We can take a look at the `insecure` option. This is dangerous because users can use ports above 1024. The first 1024 ports can only be used by root. This prevents the fact that no users can use sockets above port 1024 for the NFS service and interact with it.

***

### Footprinting the Service

When footprinting NFS, the TCP ports `111` and `2049` are essential. We can also get information about the NFS service and the host via RPC, as shown below in the example.

**Nmap**

NFS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC

```

The `rpcinfo` NSE script retrieves a list of all currently running RPC services, their names and descriptions, and the ports they use. This lets us check whether the target share is connected to the network on all required ports. Also, for NFS, Nmap has some NSE scripts that can be used for the scans. These can then show us, for example, the `contents` of the share and its `stats`.

Once we have discovered such an NFS service, we can mount it on our local machine. For this, we can create a new empty folder to which the NFS share will be mounted. Once mounted, we can navigate it and view the contents just like our local system.

**Show Available NFS Shares**

NFS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ showmount -e 10.129.14.128

Export list for 10.129.14.128:
/mnt/nfs 10.129.14.0/24
```

**Mounting NFS Share**

NFS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ mkdir target-NFS
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cd target-NFS
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ tree .

.
└── mnt
    └── nfs
        ├── id_rsa
        ├── id_rsa.pub
        └── nfs.share

2 directories, 3 files
```

There we will have the opportunity to access the rights and the usernames and groups to whom the shown and viewable files belong. Because once we have the usernames, group names, UIDs, and GUIDs, we can create them on our system and adapt them to the NFS share to view and modify the files.

**List Contents with Usernames & Group Names**

NFS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ls -l mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root        0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

**List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs**

NFS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ls -n mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0 1000 1221 Sep 19 18:21 backup.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0 1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0  348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0    0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

It is important to note that if the `root_squash` option is set, we cannot edit the `backup.sh` file even as `root`.

We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS share that has the `SUID` of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user.

After we have done all the necessary steps and obtained the information we need, we can unmount the NFS share.

**Unmounting**

NFS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cd ..
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo umount ./target-NFS
```
