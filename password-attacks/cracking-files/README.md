# Cracking Files

## Protected Files

***

The use of file encryption is often still lacking in `private` and `business` matters. Even today, emails containing job applications, account statements, or contracts are often sent unencrypted. This is grossly negligent and, in many cases, even punishable by law. For example, GDPR demands the requirement for encrypted storage and transmission of personal data in the European Union. Especially in business cases, this is quite different for emails. Nowadays, it is pretty common to communicate `confidential` topics or send `sensitive` data `by email`. However, emails are not much more secure than postcards, which can be intercepted if the attacker is positioned correctly.

More and more companies are increasing their IT security precautions and infrastructure through training courses and security awareness seminars. As a result, it is becoming increasingly common for company employees to encrypt/encode sensitive files. Nevertheless, even these can be cracked and read with the right choice of lists and tools. In many cases, `symmetric encryption` like `AES-256` is used to securely store individual files or folders. Here, the `same key` is used to encrypt and decrypt a file.

Therefore, for sending files, `asymmetric encryption` is used, in which `two separate keys` are required. The sender encrypts the file with the `public key` of the recipient. The recipient, in turn, can then decrypt the file using a `private key`.

### Hunting for Encoded Files

Many different file extensions can identify these types of encrypted/encoded files. For example, a useful list can be found on [FileInfo](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/encoded). However, for our example, we will only look at the most common files like the following:

**Hunting for Files**

Protected Files

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for ext in $(echo ".xls .xls* .xltx .csv .od* .doc .doc* .pdf .pot .pot* .pp*");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $ext; find / -name *$ext 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done

File extension:  .xls

File extension:  .xls*

...SNIP...
```

If we encounter file extensions on the system that we are not familiar with, we can use the search engines that we are familiar with to find out the technology behind them. After all, there are hundreds of different file extensions, and no one is expected to know all of them by heart. First, however, we should know how to find the relevant information that will help us. Again, we can use the steps we already covered in the `Credential Hunting` sections or repeat them to find SSH keys on the system.

**Hunting for SSH Keys**

Protected Files

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"

/home/cry0l1t3/.ssh/internal_db:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/cry0l1t3/.ssh/SSH.private:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/cry0l1t3/Mgmt/ceil.key:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Most SSH keys we will find nowadays are encrypted. We can recognize this by the header of the SSH key because this shows the encryption method in use.

**Encrypted SSH Keys**

Protected Files

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ cat /home/cry0l1t3/.ssh/SSH.private

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,2109D25CC91F8DBFCEB0F7589066B2CC

8Uboy0afrTahejVGmB7kgvxkqJLOczb1I0/hEzPU1leCqhCKBlxYldM2s65jhflD
4/OH4ENhU7qpJ62KlrnZhFX8UwYBmebNDvG12oE7i21hB/9UqZmmHktjD3+OYTsD
...SNIP...
```

If we see such a header in an SSH key, we will, in most cases, not be able to use it immediately without further action. This is because encrypted SSH keys are protected with a passphrase that must be entered before use. However, many are often careless in the password selection and its complexity because SSH is considered a secure protocol, and many do not know that even lightweight [AES-128-CBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced\_Encryption\_Standard) can be cracked.

### Cracking with John

`John The Ripper` has many different scripts to generate hashes from files that we can then use for cracking. We can find these scripts on our system using the following command.

**John Hashing Scripts**

Protected Files

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ locate *2john*

/usr/bin/bitlocker2john
/usr/bin/dmg2john
/usr/bin/gpg2john
/usr/bin/hccap2john
/usr/bin/keepass2john
/usr/bin/putty2john
/usr/bin/racf2john
/usr/bin/rar2john
/usr/bin/uaf2john
/usr/bin/vncpcap2john
/usr/bin/wlanhcx2john
/usr/bin/wpapcap2john
/usr/bin/zip2john
/usr/share/john/1password2john.py
/usr/share/john/7z2john.pl
/usr/share/john/DPAPImk2john.py
/usr/share/john/adxcsouf2john.py

/usr/share/john/aix2john.py
/usr/share/john/andotp2john.py
/usr/share/john/androidbackup2john.py
...SNIP...
```

We can convert many different formats into single hashes and try to crack the passwords with this. Then, we can open, read, and use the file if we succeed. There is a Python script called `ssh2john.py` for SSH keys, which generates the corresponding hashes for encrypted SSH keys, which we can then store in files.

Protected Files

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ssh2john.py SSH.private > ssh.hash
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cat ssh.hash 

ssh.private:$sshng$0$8$1C258238FD2D6EB0$2352$f7b...SNIP...
```

Next, we need to customize the commands accordingly with the password list and specify our file with the hashes as the target to be cracked. After that, we can display the cracked hashes by specifying the hash file and using the `--show` option.

### Cracking Documents

In the course of our career, we will come across many different documents, which are also password-protected to prevent access by unauthorized persons. Today, most people use Office and PDF files to exchange business information and data.

Pretty much all reports, documentation, and information sheets can be found in the form of Office DOCs and PDFs. This is because they offer the best visual representation of information. John provides a Python script called `office2john.py` to extract hashes from all common Office documents that can then be fed into John or Hashcat for offline cracking. The procedure to crack them remains the same.

One of the major difficulties in this process is the generation and mutation of password lists. This is the prerequisite for successfully cracking the passwords for all password-protected files and access points. This is because it is often no longer sufficient to use a known password list in most cases, as these are known to the systems and are often recognized and blocked by integrated security mechanisms. These types of files may be more difficult to crack (or not crackable at all within a reasonable amount of time) because users may be forced to select a longer, randomly generated password or a passphrase. Nevertheless, it is always worth attempting to crack password-protected documents as they may yield sensitive data that could be useful to further our access.
