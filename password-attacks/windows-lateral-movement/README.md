# Windows Lateral Movement

Windows Lateral Movement refers to the technique used by attackers to move horizontally across a network from one compromised system to another. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or weak configurations in network services, protocols, or user accounts to gain unauthorized access to additional systems within the network. They may use techniques like pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, or exploitation of unsecured administrative shares to escalate privileges and spread laterally. This technique allows attackers to move stealthily within the network, increasing the scope of their compromise and facilitating further exploitation or data exfiltration. Organizations can mitigate the risk of lateral movement by implementing strong access controls, segmenting network resources, monitoring network traffic for suspicious behavior, and promptly patching known vulnerabilities.
