# Password Mutations

Many people create their passwords according to `simplicity instead of security`. To eliminate this human weakness that often compromises security measures, password policies can be created on all systems that determine how a password should look. This means that the system recognizes whether the password contains capital letters, special characters, and numbers. In addition, most password policies require a minimum length of eight characters in a password, including at least one of the above specifications.

In the previous sections, we guessed very simple passwords, but it becomes much more difficult to adapt this to systems that apply password policies that force the creation of more complex passwords.

Unfortunately, the tendency for users to create weak passwords also occurs despite the existence of password policies. Most people/employees follow the same rules when creating more complex passwords. Passwords are often created closely related to the service used. This means that many employees often select passwords that can have the company's name in the passwords. A person's preferences and interests also play a significant role. These can be pets, friends, sports, hobbies, and many other elements of life. `OSINT` information gathering can be very helpful for finding out more about a user's preferences and may assist with password guessing. More information about OSINT can be found in the [OSINT: Corporate Recon module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/osint-corporate-recon). Commonly, users use the following additions for their password to fit the most common password policies:

| **Description**                        | **Password Syntax** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| First letter is uppercase.             | `Password`          |
| Adding numbers.                        | `Password123`       |
| Adding year.                           | `Password2022`      |
| Adding month.                          | `Password02`        |
| Last character is an exclamation mark. | `Password2022!`     |
| Adding special characters.             | `P@ssw0rd2022!`     |

Considering that many people want to keep their passwords as simple as possible despite password policies, we can create rules for generating weak passwords. Based on statistics provided by [WPengine](https://wpengine.com/resources/passwords-unmasked-infographic/), most password lengths are `not longer` than `ten` characters. So what we can do is to pick specific terms that are at least `five` characters long and seem to be the most familiar to the users, such as the names of their pets, hobbies, preferences, and other interests. If the user chooses a single word (such as the current month), adds the `current year`, followed by a special character, at the end of their password, we would reach the `ten-character` password requirement. Considering that most companies require regular password changes, a user can modify their password by just changing the name of a month or a single number, etc. Let's use a simple example to create a password list with only one entry.

**Password List**

Password Mutations

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cat password.list

password
```

We can use a very powerful tool called [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists. To become more familiar with Hashcat and discover the full potential of this tool, we recommend the module [Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat). Hashcat uses a specific syntax for defining characters and words and how they can be modified. The complete list of this syntax can be found in the official [documentation](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule\_based\_attack) of Hashcat. However, the ones listed below are enough for us to understand how Hashcat mutates words.

| **Function** | **Description**                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `:`          | Do nothing.                                       |
| `l`          | Lowercase all letters.                            |
| `u`          | Uppercase all letters.                            |
| `c`          | Capitalize the first letter and lowercase others. |
| `sXY`        | Replace all instances of X with Y.                |
| `$!`         | Add the exclamation character at the end.         |

Each rule is written on a new line which determines how the word should be mutated. If we write the functions shown above into a file and consider the aspects mentioned, this file can then look like this:

**Hashcat Rule File**

Password Mutations

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cat custom.rule

:
c
so0
c so0
sa@
c sa@
c sa@ so0
$!
$! c
$! so0
$! sa@
$! c so0
$! c sa@
$! so0 sa@
$! c so0 sa@
```

Hashcat will apply the rules of `custom.rule` for each word in `password.list` and store the mutated version in our `mut_password.list` accordingly. Thus, one word will result in fifteen mutated words in this case.

**Generating Rule-based Wordlist**

Password Mutations

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cat mut_password.list

password
Password
passw0rd
Passw0rd
p@ssword
P@ssword
P@ssw0rd
password!
Password!
passw0rd!
p@ssword!
Passw0rd!
P@ssword!
p@ssw0rd!
P@ssw0rd!
```

`Hashcat` and `John` come with pre-built rule lists that we can use for our password generating and cracking purposes. One of the most used rules is `best64.rule`, which can often lead to good results. It is important to note that password cracking and the creation of custom wordlists is a guessing game in most cases. We can narrow this down and perform more targeted guessing if we have information about the password policy and take into account the company name, geographical region, industry, and other topics/words that users may select from to create their passwords. Exceptions are, of course, cases where passwords are leaked and found.

**Hashcat Existing Rules**

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ls /usr/share/hashcat/rules/

best64.rule                  specific.rule

d3ad0ne.rule                 T0XlC-insert_space_and_special_0_F.rule

```

We can now use another tool called [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to scan potential words from the company's website and save them in a separate list. We can then combine this list with the desired rules and create a customized password list that has a higher probability of guessing a correct password. We specify some parameters, like the depth to spider (`-d`), the minimum length of the word (`-m`), the storage of the found words in lowercase (`--lowercase`), as well as the file where we want to store the results (`-w`).

**Generating Wordlists Using CeWL**

Password Mutations

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ wc -l inlane.wordlist
