## Attacking DNS

***

The [Domain Name System](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) (`DNS`) translates domain names (e.g., hackthebox.com) to the numerical IP addresses (e.g., 104.17.42.72). DNS is mostly `UDP/53`, but DNS will rely on `TCP/53` more heavily as time progresses. DNS has always been designed to use both UDP and TCP port 53 from the start, with UDP being the default, and falls back to using TCP when it cannot communicate on UDP, typically when the packet size is too large to push through in a single UDP packet. Since nearly all network applications use DNS, attacks against DNS servers represent one of the most prevalent and significant threats today.

### Enumeration

DNS holds interesting information for an organization. As discussed in the Domain Information section in the [Footprinting module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/footprinting), we can understand how a company operates and the services they provide, as well as third-party service providers like emails.

The Nmap `-sC` (default scripts) and `-sV` (version scan) options can be used to perform initial enumeration against the target DNS servers:

Attacking DNS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]# nmap -p53 -Pn -sV -sC 10.10.110.213

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-29 03:47 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.110.213
Host is up (0.017s latency).

PORT    STATE  SERVICE     VERSION
53/tcp  open   domain      ISC BIND 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.2 (Ubuntu Linux)
```

***

### DNS Zone Transfer

A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that a specific organization or administrator manages. Since DNS comprises multiple DNS zones, DNS servers utilize DNS zone transfers to copy a portion of their database to another DNS server. Unless a DNS server is configured correctly (limiting which IPs can perform a DNS zone transfer), anyone can ask a DNS server for a copy of its zone information since DNS zone transfers do not require any authentication. In addition, the DNS service usually runs on a UDP port; however, when performing DNS zone transfer, it uses a TCP port for reliable data transmission.

An attacker could leverage this DNS zone transfer vulnerability to learn more about the target organization's DNS namespace, increasing the attack surface. For exploitation, we can use the `dig` utility with DNS query type `AXFR` option to dump the entire DNS namespaces from a vulnerable DNS server:

**DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer**

Attacking DNS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]# dig AXFR @ns1.inlanefreight.htb inlanefreight.htb

```

Tools like [Fierce](https://github.com/mschwager/fierce) can also be used to enumerate all DNS servers of the root domain and scan for a DNS zone transfer:

### Domain Takeovers & Subdomain Enumeration

`Domain takeover` is registering a non-existent domain name to gain control over another domain. If attackers find an expired domain, they can claim that domain to perform further attacks such as hosting malicious content on a website or sending a phishing email leveraging the claimed domain.

Domain takeover is also possible with subdomains called `subdomain takeover`. A DNS's canonical name (`CNAME`) record is used to map different domains to a parent domain. Many organizations use third-party services like AWS, GitHub, Akamai, Fastly, and other content delivery networks (CDNs) to host their content. In this case, they usually create a subdomain and make it point to those services. For example,

Attacking DNS

```shell-session
sub.target.com.   60   IN   CNAME   anotherdomain.com
```

The domain name (e.g., `sub.target.com`) uses a CNAME record to another domain (e.g., `anotherdomain.com`). Suppose the `anotherdomain.com` expires and is available for anyone to claim the domain since the `target.com`'s DNS server has the `CNAME` record. In that case, anyone who registers `anotherdomain.com` will have complete control over `sub.target.com` until the DNS record is updated.

**Subdomain Enumeration**

Before performing a subdomain takeover, we should enumerate subdomains for a target domain using tools like [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder). This tool can scrape subdomains from open sources like [DNSdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/). Other tools like [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) can also be used to brute-force subdomains by supplying a pre-generated wordlist:

Attacking DNS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]# ./subfinder -d inlanefreight.com -v       
                                                                       
        _     __ _         _                                           
____  _| |__ / _(_)_ _  __| |___ _ _          
(_-< || | '_ \  _| | ' \/ _  / -_) '_|                 
/__/\_,_|_.__/_| |_|_||_\__,_\___|_| v2.4.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                projectdiscovery.io

An excellent alternative is a tool called [Subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute). This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.

**Subbrute**

Attacking DNS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cd subbrute
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ echo "ns1.inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ./subbrute inlanefreight.com -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt

Warning: Fewer than 16 resolvers per process, consider adding more nameservers to resolvers.txt.
inlanefreight.com
ns2.inlanefreight.com
www.inlanefreight.com
ms1.inlanefreight.com
support.inlanefreight.com

<SNIP>
```

Sometimes internal physical configurations are poorly secured, which we can exploit to upload our tools from a USB stick. Another scenario would be that we have reached an internal host through pivoting and want to work from there. Of course, there are other alternatives, but it does not hurt to know alternative ways and possibilities.

The tool has found four subdomains associated with `inlanefreight.com`. Using the `nslookup` or `host` command, we can enumerate the `CNAME` records for those subdomains.

Attacking DNS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]# host support.inlanefreight.com

support.inlanefreight.com is an alias for inlanefreight.s3.amazonaws.com
```

The `support` subdomain has an alias record pointing to an AWS S3 bucket. However, the URL `https://support.inlanefreight.com` shows a `NoSuchBucket` error indicating that the subdomain is potentially vulnerable to a subdomain takeover. Now, we can take over the subdomain by creating an AWS S3 bucket with the same subdomain name.

The [can-i-take-over-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz) repository is also an excellent reference for a subdomain takeover vulnerability. It shows whether the target services are vulnerable to a subdomain takeover and provides guidelines on assessing the vulnerability.

### DNS Spoofing

DNS spoofing is also referred to as DNS Cache Poisoning. This attack involves altering legitimate DNS records with false information so that they can be used to redirect online traffic to a fraudulent website. Example attack paths for the DNS Cache Poisoning are as follows:

* An attacker could intercept the communication between a user and a DNS server to route the user to a fraudulent destination instead of a legitimate one by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (`MITM`) attack.
* Exploiting a vulnerability found in a DNS server could yield control over the server by an attacker to modify the DNS records.

**Local DNS Cache Poisoning**

From a local network perspective, an attacker can also perform DNS Cache Poisoning using MITM tools like [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) or [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/).

To exploit the DNS cache poisoning via `Ettercap`, we should first edit the `/etc/ettercap/etter.dns` file to map the target domain name (e.g., `inlanefreight.com`) that they want to spoof and the attacker's IP address (e.g., `192.168.225.110`) that they want to redirect a user to:

Attacking DNS

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]# cat /etc/ettercap/etter.dns

inlanefreight.com      A   192.168.225.110
*.inlanefreight.com    A   192.168.225.110
```

Next, start the `Ettercap` tool and scan for live hosts within the network by navigating to `Hosts > Scan for Hosts`. Once completed, add the target IP address (e.g., `192.168.152.129`) to Target1 and add a default gateway IP (e.g., `192.168.152.2`) to Target2.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/target.png)

Activate `dns_spoof` attack by navigating to `Plugins > Manage Plugins`. This sends the target machine with fake DNS responses that will resolve `inlanefreight.com` to IP address `192.168.225.110`:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/etter\_plug.png)

After a successful DNS spoof attack, if a victim user coming from the target machine `192.168.152.129` visits the `inlanefreight.com` domain on a web browser, they will be redirected to a `Fake page` that is hosted on IP address `192.168.225.110`:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/etter\_site.png)

In addition, a ping coming from the target IP address `192.168.152.129` to `inlanefreight.com` should be resolved to `192.168.225.110` as well:

Attacking DNS

```cmd-session
C:\>ping inlanefreight.com

Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:

```

These are a few examples of common DNS attacks. There are other more advanced attacks that will be covered in later modules.
