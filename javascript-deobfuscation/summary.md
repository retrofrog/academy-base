# Summary

Congratulations on reaching the end of `JavaScript Deobfuscation`. We hope you can now recognize obfuscated scripts and deobfuscate them, decode their output, and replicate their functions.

The following is a summary of what we learned:

* First, we uncovered the `HTML` source code of the webpage and located the JavaScript code.
* Then, we learned about various ways to obfuscate JavaScript code.
* After that, we learned how to beautify and deobfuscate minified and obfuscated JavaScript code.
* Next, we went through the deobfuscated code and analyzed its main function
* We then learned about HTTP requests and were able to replicate the main function of the obfuscated JavaScript code.
* Finally, we learned about various methods to encode and decode strings
